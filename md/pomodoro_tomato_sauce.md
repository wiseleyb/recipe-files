# Notes

The difference between Marinara and Pomodoro is Marinara would have similar ingredients finely diced and kept in the sauce. Pomodoro is great for super simple pasta dishes or as a pizza sauce on Neopolitan style pizzas when you want a bit less acid (when you cook tomatoes the acidity drops)
