## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon (6g) kosher salt
- 5 tablespoons dark brown sugar (2 1/4 ounces; 65g)
- Large pinch cayenne pepper
- 1 teaspoon (2g) ground coriander
- 1/2 teaspoon (1g) ground fennel seed
- 1 tablespoon (6g) paprika
- 1 teaspoon (2g) ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon (2g) freshly ground black pepper
- 1 whole bone-in or boneless pork butt (5 to 7 pounds; 2.25 to 3kg)
- 1 cup ketchup (8 ounces; about 225g)
- 1/2 cup dark molasses (4 ounces; about 115g)
- 2 tablespoons (30ml) Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tablespoon (15ml) high-quality liquid smoke, such as Wright's (see note above)
- 1 tablespoon (15ml) brown mustard
- 2 teaspoons (10ml) hot sauce
- 1/2 cup (120ml) cider vinegar, divided
- 1 tablespoon (15ml) vegetable oil
- 1 large onion, finely minced (about 6 ounces; 170g)
- 1 cup (240ml) bourbon
- 1/2 cup (120ml) homemade or store-bought low-sodium chicken stock or water

## Directions

1. Adjust oven rack to lower position and preheat oven to 300°F (150°C).
   Combine salt, sugar, cayenne pepper, coriander, fennel seed, paprika, cumin,
   and black pepper in a small bowl and mix until homogeneous. Season pork with
   2 to 3 tablespoons spice mixture, making sure to rub it on all sides.
   Reserve remaining spice mixture.

2. Whisk together ketchup, molasses, Worcestershire sauce, liquid smoke,
   mustard, hot sauce, and half of cider vinegar in a medium bowl. Whisk in
   remaining spice mixture. Set aside.

3. Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add pork
   and cook, turning occasionally, until well browned on all sides, about 5
   minutes total. (Pork will brown fast because of the sugar. Do not let it
   burn.) Add onion and cook, stirring and scraping up browned bits from the
   bottom of the pan, until softened, about 2 minutes.

4. Turn off burner and add bourbon. Relight burner. Carefully ignite the
   bourbon with a long match or lighter. (Stand back and make sure there is
   nothing flammable above it; it will produce tall flames.) Let cook until
   flames die out, about 2 minutes.

5. Add half of sauce mixture and chicken stock or water. Cover Dutch oven,
   transfer to oven, and cook until pork is just starting to turn tender, about
   4 hours. Remove lid and continue cooking until a knife or fork shows very
   little resistance when twisted inside the meat and a dark bark has formed,
   about 1 hour longer.

6. Transfer pork to a large bowl, reserving liquid in pot. Using a ladle, skim
   off excess fat and discard. Add reserved sauce and remaining vinegar to pot
   and whisk to combine. When pork is cool enough to handle, shred with two
   forks.

7. Transfer shredded pork to pot and toss with sauce. (If making ahead to serve
   over the course of several meals, store pork and sauce separately, adding
   sauce only to the portion you are serving immediately.) Season to taste with
   more salt, sugar, liquid smoke, or cider vinegar. Serve.
