- 2 cups granulated sugar
- 2 cups cold water

For the peach puree:

- 10 ounces semi-frozen peaches
- 1/2 cup ginger simple syrup

## Directions

Begin by making the ginger simple syrup. Peel and grate the ginger. Add it together with the sugar and cold water to a saucepan. Bring it to the boil and stir until the sugar dissolves. Cover and let steep for 15 minutes. Strain, discard ginger pieces and set simple syrup aside.

In a blender add frozen peaches and ginger simple syrup. Blend until completely pureed then place into the refrigerator to cool.

For serving: Add ice cubes to a cocktail shaker and fill half way with peach puree. Top off with Champagne and shake vigorously to combine. Pour into Champagne glasses and repeat process as needed.
