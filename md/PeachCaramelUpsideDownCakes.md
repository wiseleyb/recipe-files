## Directions

Preheat oven to 350  
  
 Set 6 8oz, 4" diameter, straight-sided oven proof ramekins on baking sheet and brush with butter, then pour 1 tsp butter into bottom of each ramekin  
  
 Carmel: combine sugar with 3 tbs water in small heavy sauce pan. Stir over low heat until disolved. Raise heat to high and cook, without stiring, until dark golden brown. Swirl pan occasionally.   
  
 Pour caramel into ramekins and allow to cool slightly.  
  
 Add peach slices in a single layer.   
  
 Cake: Combine flour, cornmeal, baking powder and salt in a bowl - set aside. Cream butter and 3/4 cup sugar until light and smooth. Add egg yolks and vanilla and mix on medium speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add dry ingredients in three additions, alternating with milk.   
  
 Clean bowl and whip the egg whites with 2 tbs sugar until stiff. Fold into batter.  
  
 Scoop batter into ramekins, bake 30-35 minutes.  
  
 Remove from oven and immediately unmold them (must be done while very hot).   
  
 Serve with whip and ice cream.
