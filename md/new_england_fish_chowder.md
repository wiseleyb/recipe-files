## Directions

(Jasper White): By rights any fish can be used for chowder, and often is. But the very best fish chowder is made with cod or one of it's relatives. Salmon, monkfish, ,tautog, tilefish and wolffish also make a very good chowder. Finely textured fish like flounder, mackerel and sea bass are not good for chowder; they fall apart too easily. After very fresh fish, the most important ingredient is a good, strong Fish Stock. To keep the fish from breaking up too much, I have learned to add the fillets whole or in as large pieces as possible. They will break up by themselves as the chowder is stirred. The exception to this is tautog and tile fish, which are very firm; you should cut them into one-inch pieces.

1. Prepare the fish by removing any excess skin and picking out any bones with a pair of tweezers. If you use a knife to cut out bones, be sure to leave the fillets in as large pieces as possible.  
  
2. Render the salt pork in a large soup pot until it begins to crips. Add the butter, onions, bay leaves and thyme. Cook for 5 minutes or until the onions become soft. Add the potatoes and sish stock and simmer for 20 minutes or until the potatoes are tender.  
  
3. Remove the bay leaves and add the cod fillets and heavy cream. Simmer slowly until the fish is cooked through and begins to flake (about 8 to 10 minutes). Season to taste and stir in parsley and/or chervil. Remove from heat.  
  
4. Unsing a slotted spoon, transfer the chunks of fish, the onions and potatoes to soup plates; then ladle over the piping hot broth. Put a dollop of butter into each plate of soup and server with crackers or biscuits.

## Note

We couldn't find fish stock the other night so we used [Better Than Bouillon's Lobster Base](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00016LA8Y/sr=1-1/qid=1134390907/ref=sr_1_1/102-1422794-7281716?%5Fencoding=UTF8&n=3580501&s=gourmet-food&v=glance "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00016LA8Y/sr=1-1/qid=1134390907/ref=sr 1 1/102-1422794-7281716? encoding=UTF8&n=3580501&s=gourmet-food&v=glance") and threw in a chicken stock cube. It was worlds better than when we've made this with just fish stock.
