## Ingredients

- 2 pounds Roma tomatoes, cored and cut in half 
- 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons olive oil 
- Salt 
- Freshly ground black pepper 
- 2 cups chicken stock 
- 1 cup black olives, sliced 
- 1 cup green queen size stuffed olives, sliced 
- 2 tablespoons minced shallots 
- 2 teaspoons minced garlic 
- 2 tablespoons small diced celery 
- 2 tablespoons chopped parsley 
- 1 pound calamari, thawed, cut into 1/4-inch slices 
- 1/2 cup buttermilk 
- Essence, recipe follows 
- 1 cup masa flour 
- 1 cup flour 
- 2 ounces grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

## Directions

In a mixing bowl, toss the tomatoes with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Season with salt and pepper. Place the tomatoes on the smoker rack and smoke for 15 minutes. Remove from the smoker and place both the tomatoes and tomato juice in a medium saucepan. Add the chicken stock. Bring the liquid to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Cook for 30 minutes. Using a hand-held blender, puree the sauce until smooth. Strain and season with salt and pepper. Keep warm. In a mixing bowl, combine the olives, shallots, garlic, celery, parsley, black pepper and the 1/2 cup of the olive oil. Mix well. In a mixing bowl, marinate the cut calamari in the buttermilk with 2 tablespoons Essence, allow to sit for 20 minutes. Combine the masa and flours together with the remaining Essence. For olive salad, combine all the ingredients together and set aside. Dredge the marinated calamari in the flour mixture and sift to remove any excess. Place dredged calamari in the fryer basket and deep fry until slightly golden in color, about 2 to 3 minutes. Stir constantly to prevent from sticking together. Remove from the fryer and drain on a paper-lined plate. Season with Essence. To serve, spoon the sauce in the center of a large platter. Place the calamari on top of the sauce. Mound the olive salad on top of the calamari. Garnish with the cheese.
