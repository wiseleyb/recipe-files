## Ingredients

- 1.5 tbs olive oil
- 1 cup chopped onion
- 1. cups uncooked basmati rice
- 1 cup diced plum tomato
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 (14oz) can chicken broth
- 1 (3-inch) cinnamon stick
- 1 (6oz) package baby spinach
- 2 cups chopped roasted skinless chicken breasts (2 about 2)
- 1/2 cup coarsely chopped walnuts, toasted
- 1 tbs finely chopped dill

## Directions

Pilaf has many variations. This Turkish version gains flavore from popcorn-scented basmati rice and fresh dill. Don't stir the rice as it summers; doing so makes it gummy. Use leftover meat from a roasted chicken, or pick up a rotisserie chicken from your supermarket.  
  
 1. Heat 1 tbs oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion, saute 10 minutes or until lightly browned. Stir in rice, and cook 1 minutes, stirring constantly. Stir in 1.5 tsp oil, tomato, salt, broth, and cinnamon stick, bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat, and simmer 15 minutes or until liquid is absorbed.  
  
 2. Stir in spinach; cook 2 miuntes or until spinach wilts. Stir in chicken. Sprinkle evenly with walnuts and dill. Discard cinnamon stick.
