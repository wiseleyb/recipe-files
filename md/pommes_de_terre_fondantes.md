## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups homemade chicken [try this](https://github.com/wiseleyb/recipe-files/blob/master/md/chicken-stock_sauce.md) or beef stock, or store-bought low-sodium chicken broth, plus extra as needed
- 1/4 ounce (2 1/2 teaspoons; 1 packet; 7g) unflavored gelatin, such as Knox
- 2 1/2 pounds (1.1kg) Yukon Gold potatoes, about 2 1/2 to 3 inches long each, peeled
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons (30ml) vegetable oil, beef fat, schmaltz, or duck fat (see note)
- 4 tablespoons (55g) unsalted butter
- 3 medium garlic cloves (15g), peeled and smashed
- 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves, chopped
- Flaky sea salt, such as Maldon, for finishing (optional)

## Directions

Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 450°F (230°C). Place
stock in a liquid measuring cup or small bowl and sprinkle gelatin over top.
Set aside.

Using a sharp knife, cut off ends of potatoes to give them flat sides, then
halve potatoes crosswise. Pat dry with paper towels.

In a 12-inch stainless steel straight-sided sauté pan or skillet, or cast iron
skillet, heat oil or fat over medium-high heat until just beginning to smoke.
Season potatoes with salt and pepper and add to skillet, broad side down, in a
single layer with space between each piece. Cook, without moving, until
potatoes begin to brown around edges, 4 to 5 minutes. Continue to cook,
rotating and swirling pan gently to promote even browning and prevent sticking,
until potatoes are deeply browned on bottom side, 3 to 4 minutes longer,
adjusting heat as needed if some of the pieces brown too quickly.

Using a thin metal spatula, flip potatoes onto second flat side. Add butter and
cook, swirling constantly, until butter is melted and begins to foam, about 1
minute. Add garlic and thyme, and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute.
Add stock and bring to a boil.

Transfer skillet to oven and roast until potatoes are completely tender,
offering little to no resistance when poked with a paring knife, and liquid is
reduced to a saucy consistency, 25 to 30 minutes.

Return skillet to stovetop. Using a thin metal spatula or tongs, transfer
potatoes to a serving platter, broad side up, leaving sauce in the skillet;
discard garlic. Bring sauce to a simmer over medium heat and cook, swirling and
stirring constantly, until sauce is emulsified, 30 seconds to 1 minute. If
emulsion appears broken or sauce is too thick, add more stock or water, 1
tablespoon (15ml) at a time, until you reach the desired consistency. Season to
taste with salt and pepper and pour sauce over and around potatoes. Sprinkle
with flaky sea salt (if using, otherwise season with a little more kosher
salt), and serve.
