## Ingredients

- 12 tablespoons/170 grams unsalted butter, melted, plus more for buttering the pan
- 1 1/2 cups/180 grams all-purpose flour
- 1 1/2 cup/300 grams packed dark brown sugar, divided
- 1 cup/80 grams old-fashioned rolled oats
- 1 cup/113 grams pecans, chopped
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 3 1/2 pounds mixed apples, such as Granny Smith, Macintosh, and Pink Lady, peeled, cored, and cut into 1/2-inch wedges (about 8 medium apples)
- 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
- 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice

## Directions

Step 1

Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Butter a 13-by-9-inch baking dish. In a medium
bowl, combine the flour, 1 cup/200 grams of the brown sugar, oats, pecans and
salt. Add the butter, and stir with a fork until the crumbs are evenly
moistened.

Step 2

Add the apples to the buttered baking dish and toss with the remaining 1/2
cup/100 grams brown sugar, cinnamon and lemon juice. Spread the apples into an
even layer. Press the crumb mixture together to create clumps of different
sizes, and sprinkle on top of the apples. Transfer to the oven, and bake until
the apples are tender and the crumb topping is crisp and deep golden brown,
about 50 to 60 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.

## Notes

Use cold butter and cut it into the brown sugar and flour first (like you would with a pie crust)

No need to peel apples
