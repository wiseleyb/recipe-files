## Ingredients

- 1 cup vegetable oil
- 1 cup flour
- 1.5 cups chopped onions
- 1 cup chopped celery
- 1 cup chopped bell peppers
- 1 pound smoked sausage, such as Andouille or Kiebasa, cut crosswise into 1/2-inch slices
- 1.5 teaspoons salt
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne
- 3 bay leaves
- 6 cups chicken stock (or water)
- 1 pound boneless chicken meat, cut into 1-inch chunks
- 1 teaspoon Rustic Rub
- 2 tablespoons chopped parsley
- 1/2 cup chopped green onions
- 1 tablespoon fil powder

## Directions

Combine the oil and flour in a large cast-iron or enameled cast-iron Dutch oven, over medium heat. Stirring slowly and constantly for 20 to 25 minutes, make a dark brown roux, the color of chocolate. You must be very careful not to burn the flour, if black specs develop start over. You need to stir constantly to avoid this.  
  
 Add the onions, celery, and bell peppers and continue to stir for 4 to 5 minutes, or until wilted. Add the sausage, salt, cayenne, and bay leaves. Continue to stir for 3 to 4 minutes. Add the water. Stir until the roux mixture and stock/water are well combined. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low. Cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour. Season the chicken with the rub and add to the pot. Simmer for 2 hours. Skim off any fat that rises to the surface. Remove from the heat. Stir in the parsley, green onions, and fil powder. Remove the bay leaves and serve in deep bowls.
