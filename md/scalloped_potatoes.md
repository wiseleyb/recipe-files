## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 small onion, minced
- 2 medium cloves garlic, minced
- 3 cups heavy cream
- 1 cup whole milk
- 4 sprigs fresh thyme leaves
- 2 bay leaves
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 4 pounds russet potatoes, cut into 1/8-inch-thick slices
- 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese (about 4 ounces)

## Directions

1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until foaming subsides, about 1 minute. Add the onion and saute until it turns soft and begins to brown, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and saute until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the cream, milk, thyme, bay leaves, salt, pepper, and potatoes and bring to a simmer. Cover, adjusting the heat as necessary to maintain a light simmer, and cook until the potatoes are almost tender (a paring knife can be slipped into and out of the center of a potato slice with some resistance), about 15 minutes.  
  
 2. Transfer the potato mixture to a 3-quart gratin dish and sprinkle with cheese. Bake until the cream has thickened and is bubbling around the sides and the top is golden brown, about 20 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes before serving.
