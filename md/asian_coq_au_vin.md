Add onions, carrots and celery. Season. Deglaze with wines and add back the chicken. Add the bay leaves, thyme and soy sauce and check for seasoning. Add water if necessary and bring to a slow boil. Simmer for 2 hours until chicken is practically falling off of the bone. For the last 10 minutes of cooking, add the bok choy. On a large platter, place coq au vin on top of a large noodle cake. Garnish with scallions.
