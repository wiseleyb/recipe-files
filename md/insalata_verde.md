## Ingredients

**Salad**

- 2 heads butter lettuce, such as Boston or bibb
- 1 romaine heart
- 1 large Belgian endive
- 1 bunch watercress
- ½ small head frisée

**Dressing**

- 1 large shallot, minced
- 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon aged sherry vinegar, plus additional, as needed
- 1 tablespoon warm water
- 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 1/2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
- 1 1/2 teaspoons whole-grain mustard
- 1 1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/2 teaspoons honey (optional)
- 2 sprigs thyme, washed and stripped
- 1 large clove garlic, finely grated
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper

## Directions

Step 1

Wash the greens: Fill a sink or large basin with tepid water. Remove any wilted
or damaged leaves from the butter lettuce, romaine and endive. Trim each head
at the root to release whole leaves. Leave butter-lettuce leaves whole, but
halve large leaves of romaine and endive on the bias, then drop into water.
Trim and discard any roots and long stems off watercress, and drop remaining
leaves and tender stems into water. Trim and discard dark green outer leaves
and tops from frisée until only light green and white parts remain. Trim at the
root to release leaves, and drop into water. Swirl greens in water, then drain.
Wash twice more in cool, then cold, water, then transfer to a salad spinner to
dry. Gently wrap in clean dish towels, and set aside.

Step 2

Place the shallot in a fine-mesh strainer, and quickly rinse with cold water.
Allow to drain, then place in a medium bowl, and add vinegar and warm water.
Allow to sit for 2 minutes, then whisk in oil, mustards, honey (if using),
thyme, garlic and a large pinch of salt. Taste, and adjust salt and vinegar as
needed.

Step 3 To serve, gently pile a generous handful of greens into a serving bowl,
then sprinkle with salt, pepper and a generous drizzle of dressing. Continue
with another handful of salad and more seasoning and dressing, repeating until
you have a glorious, gravity-defying mound of salad. Top with a final drizzle
of dressing, and serve immediately.  Wrap remaining greens in an airtight
container or plastic bag and refrigerate for up to 3 days. Cover and
refrigerate remaining dressing for up to 3 days.

Tip

When shopping, select small, bright, fresh heads of greens.
