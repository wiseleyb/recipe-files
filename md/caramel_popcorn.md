## Ingredients

- 1/4 cup vegetable oil
- 2/3 cup popcorn kernels
- 1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter
- 1 cup light brown sugar
- 1/4 cup light corn syrup
- 1/4 cup pure maple syrup
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda

Halved 

- 1 tbsp vegetable oil
- 1/3 cup popcorn kernels
- 1/2 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter
- 1/2 cup light brown sugar
- 1 tbsp cup light corn syrup
- 1 tbsp cup pure maple syrup
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda

## Directions

Preheat your oven to 200°F and line two large rimmed baking sheets with
parchment paper.

Heat the vegetable oil in a very large pot over medium-high heat. Add the
popcorn and shake the pan to coat the kernels with oil. Cover with a tight
fitting lid (alternatively, cover tightly with foil). Wait for the popcorn to
start popping, then shake the pan gently every now and again to keep the
kernels moving. When the popping slows to about 2 seconds apart, remove the pan
from the heat. Transfer the popcorn to a large bowl, making sure to leave any
unpopped kernels behind.

In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the brown sugar,
corn syrup, maple syrup and salt and stir until the sugar dissolves. Let the
mixture come to a gentle boil. Stirring occasionally, boil the syrup over
medium heat for 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and add the baking
soda. Stir well as the mixture turns foamy.

Immediately (and carefully -- it's very hot!) pour the syrup over the popped
corn in three separate additions, stirring gently as you go, until the popcorn
is evenly coated.

Spread the caramel corn into even layers on prepared pans. Bake at 200°F for
one hour. The caramel will be a little soft at this point; let it cool
completely to crisp up. Store in an airtight container for 3-4 days.
