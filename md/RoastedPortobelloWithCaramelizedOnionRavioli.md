## Directions

For Filling #1: Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Pour olive oil into a skillet and sauti onions and garlic for approximately 2 minutes. Add mushrooms, chicken stock, salt and pepper. Put the mixture in the oven and bake for 30 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes. Once cooked, place the mushroom mixture in a food processor. Add parsley and additional salt and pepper to taste. Then, while machine is running, add enough olive oil to make a smooth filling. Process until pasty, or chunky depending on preference.   
  
 For Filling #2: Cube 2 small eggplants and then toss with oil and enough bread crumbs to coat. Salt and pepper to taste. Place in a roasting pan and bake in a preheated 400 degree for 45 minutes. After cooking put the eggplant in a mixing bowl and add mozzarella, Romano, tomato paste and whole egg. Mix until all are incorporated into a thick, and somewhat smooth mixture for the filling. Add olive oil to make a paste. Then add additional salt and pepper to taste. Put filling into already made ravioli dough.   
  
 For Ravioli Dough: Mix eggs and flour, add warm water to soften dough during kneading. Hand kneading is preferred. Knead 5 minutes for elastic consistency. Spread dough and punch out 2.1/2 to3-inch circles, the size of an open soup can. Spoon completed filling into center, leave 1/2-inch perimeter around filling. Place mixture on 1/2 of circle, fold and pinch around circumference. Make sure dough is moist. Wet finger to seal. NO air pockets, must seal tight. Boil pot of water and 1/2 tablespoon salt. Place ravioli in water. Allow to boil 1 minute after they float to the top. Remove from water and place on a plate.   
  
 For the Spinach Cream Pesto Sauce: Combine ingredients in a food processor and process. Transfer mixture to a sauti pan. Heat over low heat and then pour over ravioli's.
