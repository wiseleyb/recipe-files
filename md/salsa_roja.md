## Ingredients

- 1 ounce dried chiles de árbol (30g; about 25 dried chilies) 
- 1 ounce dried chiles pasillas (30g; 3 to 4 whole chilies) 
- 1/4 cup fresh juice from 4 to 5 limes (2 ounces; 60ml) 
- 1/4 cup fresh juice from 1 grapefruit (2 ounces; 60ml) 
- 1/4 cup fresh juice from 1 orange (2 ounces; 60ml) 
- Salt

## Directions

This is INCREDIBLY HOT (consider reducing chiles de árbol)

Use kitchen shears to trim stems from all chilies. Discard stems. Place chilies
on a microwave-safe plate and microwave on high power until fragrant and
pliable, about 20 seconds total, adding time in 5-second increments if chilies
do not smell toasted after the initial 20.

Combine chilies, lime juice, grapefruit juice, and orange juice in the jar of a
blender with a small pinch of salt. Blend at high speed until smooth. Transfer
to a bowl, let rest for 15 to 20 minutes, then stir in more salt to taste.
Salsa can be stored in a sealed container in the refrigerator for several
weeks.
