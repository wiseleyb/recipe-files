## Directions

Keang kari is an aromatic stew-like Thai-Indian curry that includes roasted garlic and shallots. It's usually prepared with meat, lamb, or chicken, along with yellow or white onions, potatoes, whole shallots, and sweet potatoes or pumpkin. Seafood is seldom used, but occasionally shrimp are included, with cherry tomatoes. Crsipy shallots top and garnish this fabulous and rich curry.

Preheat the over to 400F. Slice off the tops of the gralic and shallots. Plac3e the garlic, shallots and ginger on a sheet of aluminum foil, drizzle the oil over them, and wrap in the foil. Roast for 30 minutes. Let cool completely.  
  
 Squeeze the soft garlic from teh cloves into a bowl and set aside. Peel the ginger, mince, and set aside in a separated bowl. Squeeze the soft shallots from the skin, mince, and set aside in another bowl.  
  
 Put the coriander seeds in a 9-ince skillet and dry-roast over medium-high heat, sliding the skillet back and forth to ensure even roasting, until the seeds exude a wonderful arooma, 1 minute or less. Transfer to a plate to cool. Repeat the process with the cumin and caraway seeds. When the seeds are completely cool, grind in an electric spice or coffee grinder. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.  
  
 Using a morter and pestle, pound the sea salt and roasted garlic together into a paste. One by one, add the ginger, shallots, chiles, ground spices, curry powder, lemongrass, and turmeric in sequence, adding each new ingredient only after the previous one is pureed and incorporated into the paste. Add the fermented shirmp paste and mix well. Transfer to a jar with a tight-fitting lid and refrigerate until ready to use.
