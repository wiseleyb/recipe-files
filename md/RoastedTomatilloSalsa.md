by Tom Douglas

## Ingredients

- 8 oz (2.5 cups) tomatillos, husked, rinsed, and dried
- 2 tsp plus 1 tbs olive oil
- 1 poblano chile or other mild green chile such as Anaheim, rosted, peeled, seeded, and finely chopped
- 1 tbs finely chopped red onion
- 2 tbs fresh cilantro
- 1 tsp chopped gralic
- 1 tbs fresh lime juice
- 1 tsp seeded and minced canned chipoltle in adobo, or more to taste

## Directions

Preheat the oven to 400F. Toss the tomatillos with 2 teaspoons of olive oil in a saute pan or small metal pan (like a pie plate) and place in the oven, tossing them around a couple time until softened and lightly browned here and there, about 10 minutes. Allow the tomatillos to cool slightly, then put them on a cutting board and chop coarsely. put the tomatillos in a sieve and drain off all the liquid. Combine the drained tomatillos, roasted chile, oions, cilantro, garlic lime juice, chipotle and the remaining 1 tsb olive oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper. It's best to use the salsa the same day, but it can be kept, covered, in the refrigerator for 2 days.
