## Directions

**Pie Dough**

- Combine two thirds of flour with sugar and salt in the bowl of a food
  processor. Pulse twice to incorporate. Spread butter chunks evenly over
  surface. Pulse until no dry flour remains and dough just begins to collect in
  clumps, about 25 short pulses. Use a rubber spatula to spread the dough
  evenly around the bowl of the food processor. Sprinkle with remaining flour
  and pulse until dough is just barely broken up, about 5 short pulses.
  Transfer dough to a large bowl.
- Sprinkle with water then using a rubber spatula, fold and press dough until
  it comes together into a ball. Divide ball in half. Form each half into a
  4-inch disk. Wrap tightly in plastic and refrigerate for at least 2 hours
  before rolling and baking.

**Apple Pie**

- Adjust oven rack to lower middle position and place a heavy rimmed baking
  sheet on it. Preheat the oven to 425°F. Place apple slices in a large bowl or
  pot. Pour boiling water or cider directly over top. Cover and set aside at
  room temperature for ten minutes. Drain apples well and let sit in a colander
  in the sink, tossing occasionally until completely dry, about 10 minutes.
  Transfer to a large bowl and add 10 tablespoons sugar, cinnamon, salt, and
  cornstarch, and toss until apples are evenly coated. Set mixture aside.
- Roll one disk of pie dough into a circle roughly 12-inches in diameter.
  Transfer to a 9-inch pie plate. Add filling, discarding any excessive juices
  in the bottom of the bowl. Roll remaining disk of pie dough into a circle
  roughly 12-inches in diameter. Transfer to top of pie. Using a pair of
  kitchen shears, trim the edges of both pie crusts until they overhang the
  edge of the pie plate by 1/2 an inch all the way around. Fold edges of both
  pie crusts down together, tucking them in between the bottom crust and the
  pie plate and working your way all the way around the pie plate until
  everything is well tucked. Use the forefinger on your left hand and the thumb
  and forefinger on your right hand to crimp the edges. Cut 5 slits in the top
  with a sharp knife for ventilation.
- Use a pastry brush to brush an even coat of lightly beaten egg white all over
  the top surface of the pie. Sprinkle evenly with a tablespoon of sugar.
  Transfer pie to sheet tray in the oven and bake until light golden brown,
  about 20 minutes. Reduce heat to 375°F and continue baking until deep golden
  brown, about 25 minutes longer. Remove from oven and allow to cool at room
  temperature for at least 2 hours before serving.

**Mini Adaptation**

- Same method as **Apple Pie** above just use a 1/4 of the pie dough (you can
  freeze the rest)

## Notes

- The amount of sugar/cinnamon you use should be based on the apple tartness. I
  gradually add cinnamon-sugar untl the apples tast how I want
