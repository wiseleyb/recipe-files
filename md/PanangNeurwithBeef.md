- 3 cups fresh unsweetened coconut cream
- 0.5 cup [Panang Chile Paste](/recipe/index.php?title=Panang_Chile_Paste "Panang Chile Paste")
- 2 lbs beef tri-tip, thinkly sliced against the grain into 2-inch-long bite sized strips
- 3 tbs fish sauce (namm pla)
- 0.25 cup palm sugar or packed light brown sugar
- 6-7 kaffir lime leaves, torn, or grated zest of 1 lime

## Directions

In a 4-quart saucepan, mix 2 cups of the cocnut cream with the chile paste and heat over high heat, stirring, until it begins to boil. Lower the heat to medium-high and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 10 minutes more. Add the beef, stirring to coat well. Season with the fish sauce and palm sugar and cook, stirring, until the mixture comes back to a boil. Add the torn kaffir lime leaves, and add the remaining 1 cup coconut cream. Lower the heat to a gentle simmer and cook, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking and to ensure even cooking, until the meat is tender and the liquid has evaporated, about 1 hour.  
  
Stir in one thrid of the kaffir leaf strands and transfer to a platter. Garnish the top with the remaining kaffir lime strands and the chile slivers.  
  
Server hot or warm.
