## Ingredients

- Ravioli:
- 2 butternut squash, halved and seeded
- Pinch cinnamon
- Pinch nutmeg
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped orange zest
- 2 teaspoons chipotle puree
- 1/4 cup finely chopped parsley
- 1/4 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese
- Salt and freshly ground pepper
- 4 sheets pasta dough, 12 to 14 inches long by 4 inches wide
- 2 eggs mixed with 2 tablespoons water
- Chopped chives
- shallots
- Brown Butter Sauce:
- 2 sticks unsalted butter
- 1/4 cup coarsely ground hazelnuts 
- 1/4 cup heavy cream
- 8 sage leaves, chiffonade
- Salt and freshly ground pepper

## Directions

Ravioli:  
 Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Place squash on a baking sheet and roast until soft. Scoop out flesh and run though a food mill. Saute shallots then place the puree into a medium saucepan and cook over low heat until almost dry. Add the remaining ingredients and season with salt and pepper to taste. Lay a sheet of pasta dough on a lightly floured work surface and distribute a heaping teaspoon-sized portion of the filling at least 2 inches apart. Use your fingertip or a brush to moisten the edges of the pasta sheet with the egg wash. Carefully place a second sheet of the pasta dough on top of the first and press with your fingertips to separate the rows of filling. Repeat with the remaining dough. With a ravioli cutter or pastry wheel, cut along straight lines on the vertical and horizontal to form each ravioli square. Press the edges closed with your fingertips to seal well. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Carefully drop in the ravioli and cook for about 5 minutes. Drain, plate and spoon butter sauce over and garnish with finely chopped chives.  
  
 Brown Butter Sauce:  
 Melt butter in a medium saute pan over medium high heat. Add hazelnuts and cook until the hazelnuts are golden brown. Add the heavy cream and cook for 1 minute. Add the sage and season with salt and pepper, to taste.
