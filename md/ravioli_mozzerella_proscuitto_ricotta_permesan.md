[Original Recipe](http://www.e-rcps.com/pasta/rcp/p_opqr/rav_moz_ham.shtml "http://www.e-rcps.com/pasta/rcp/p opqr/rav moz ham.shtml")

## Ingredients

- 5 ozs ricotta
- 3/4 lb mozzarella
- 1/4 lb prosciutto crudo, a bit on the fat side, cut very thin by machine and then cut by hand into very narrow strips
- 1 oz freshly grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 T finely chopped parsley
- 1 egg
- salt
- freshly ground black pepper

## Directions

Pass the ricotta through a sieve into a bowl. Dice the mozzarella fairly finely, and add this, the ham, the 1 oz of grated Parmesan, the chopped parsley, the egg, and salt and pepper to the ingredients in the bowl.  
  
 MIX the contents of the bowl carefully until you have a smooth homogeneous paste.

I think you should probably double or triple the prosciutto in this recipe.  
  
 This recipe is really good if you then fry the ravioli.  
  
 Goes well with Spinach Pasta
