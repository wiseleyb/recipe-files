## Ingredients

- 3 cups short grain sushi rice
- 3 1/3 cups water
- 1 piece of konbu, about 4 by 3 inches (see note)
- 3/4 cup rice vinegar (see note)
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 3 teaspoons kosher salt

## Directions

1. Place rice in fine mesh strainer and rinse under cold running water, gently
   agitating with hands until liquid runs clear. Add rinsed rice and water to
   rice cooker and cook. Alternatively, place in a heavy-bottomed 2 quart
   saucepot with a tight-fitting lid. Bring to a boil over high heat, cover,
   turn heat to lowest setting, and cook for 15 minutes. Remove from heat and
   let stand 10 minutes until all liquid is absorbed and rice is tender.

2.  Meanwhile, combine konbu, vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small saucepan and
    cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until sugar and salt are
    dissolved.

3.  Transfer rice to a 13-inch by 9-inch nonreactive casserole dish (like a
    pyrex) and spread gently into an even layer using a rice paddle. Aim a fan
    set to low directly at rice and keep it running during the rest of this
    step. Carefully sprinkle 3/4 of vinegar mixture over rice by drizzling it
    over the back of the rice paddle. Combine the rice and vinegar by gently
    folding it in with a cutting motion, being careful not to bruise or crush
    any rice grains. Taste rice and, if desired, add more of vinegar mixture.
    Continue fanning rice and folding until rice stops steaming and grains have
    achieved a slightly glossy texture that just sticks together when you
    squeeze them. Keep sushi rice at room temperature covered in a clean damp
    dish towel, or plastic wrap pressed directly against its surface.

Note: follow rice directions - every type of rice is slightly different
