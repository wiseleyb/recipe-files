## Ingredients

- 1/2 pound Italian Roma tomatoes 
- 3/4 pound tomatillos, husked and washed 
- 1 cup (30 - 40) Arbol chiles 
- 1/2 bunch cilantro, leaves only, roughly chopped 
- 1 medium white onion, chopped 
- 4 garlic cloves, crushed 
- 2 cups water 
- 1 teaspoon salt 
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

## Directions

Preheat broiler. Place tomatoes and tomatillos on a baking sheet. Broil, turning occasionally until charred all over, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer to a saucepan. Add the remaining ingredients. Bring to a boil and cook until onions are soft, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a food processor or blender. Puree and then strain. Serve at room temperature or slightly chilled. Arbol salsa can be stored in the refrigerator 3 to 5 days, or frozen for weeks.
