## Ingredients

- 4 large ripe bananas 
- 2 tablespoons sugar 
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon 
- 1 recipe empanada dough, recipe follows 
- 4 ounces semisweet chocolate, broken in chunks 
- Confectioners' sugar, for dusting

## Directions

Mash the bananas, sugar, and cinnamon together in a mixing bowl until creamy, but not completely smooth - you should still have pieces of banana chunks. Spoon a generous tablespoon of the banana filling on the empanada pastry circles and stick a piece of chocolate on top. Form and bake the empanadas as directed in the recipe. Dust with confectioners' sugar and serve hot.
