# Chili Garlic Green Beans

## Credits

by Ben

## Ingredients

- 2 tbs soy sauce
- 1 tbs rice wine vinegar
- 1 tbs brown sugar
- 3 tbs Chili Garlic Sauce (see note)
- 1 tsp corn starch
- 1/2 cup water
- 3 cloves garlic (minced)
- 1 lb green beans

## Directions

In small bowl, mix soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, brown sugar and corn starch.

If you don't have Chili Garlic sauce (available in most grocery stores in the
Asian isle) you can just add red pepper flakes to the saute step.

On medium heat saute garlic for 15 seconds then add small bowl of sauce above,
water and green beans. Increase heat to medium high, cook until sauce is
reduced.

If you're adding cold green beans from the fridge this will give you fairly
crisp beans. If you want them softer just add more water.

I like to add some Marie Sharp's Habenero Pepper Sauce (available online, from
Belize).
