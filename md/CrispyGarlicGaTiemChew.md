## Ingredients

- 30 garlic cloves, peeled
- 2 cups vegetable oil
- Sea salt

## Directions

As with [Crispy Shallots (Hom Chew)](/recipe/index.php?title=Crispy_Shallots_%28Hom_Chew%29 "Crispy Shallots (Hom Chew)"), slow-cooking and patience are the key to golden crispy garlic. Thai often deep-fry the papery skins together with the garlic cloves.  
  
Fir a food processor with the steel blade, add the garlic cloves, and pulse 20 to 30 times, or until the garlic is coarsely chopped.   
  
Fry the garlic, using the same technique as for making [Crispy Shallots (Hom Chew)](/recipe/index.php?title=Crispy_Shallots_%28Hom_Chew%29 "Crispy Shallots (Hom Chew)"). Be sure to stir constantly, and let the garlic brown slowly until golden, 10 to 15 minutes. Be patient; this takes longer than you think it should. Drain as for crispy shallots, cool, and store the garlic in a jar with a tight-fitting lid at room temperature for a month.
