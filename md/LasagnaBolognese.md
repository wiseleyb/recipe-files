## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons butter 
- 6 strips bacon, diced 
- 1/4 pound ham, diced 
- 1/2 pound ground veal or ground pork, or 1/4 pound of each 
- 1 pound ground beef 
- 1 1/2 cups chopped onion 
- 1/2 cup finely chopped carrot 
- 1/2 cup finely chopped celery 
- 1/4 pound thinly sliced mushrooms 
- 3 cloves garlic, minced 
- Pinch ground cloves 
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 
- 3 tablespoons tomato paste 
- 1 cup dry white wine 
- 3 cups chicken stock 
- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper 
- 4 chicken livers, finely chopped 
- 1/2 cup heavy cream 
- 1/4 cup chopped parsley 
- 1 1/2 pounds fresh spinach pasta 
- Bechamel Sauce, recipe follows 
- 1 cup freshly grated Parmesan 
- thyme

## Directions

In a large pot heat the butter over medium high heat. Add the bacon and ham and saut until caramelized and light brown, about 10 minutes. Add the ground meats and cook over high heat until well-browned, stirring constantly, about 20 minutes.   
  
 Add the onions, carrots, celery, and mushrooms and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, cloves and nutmeg to the pan and cook for 2 minutes. Add tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes. Add the wine and cook until almost evaporated.   
  
 Add stock and simmer over medium high heat until sauce is thickened and flavorful, about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Season with salt and pepper and thyme, to taste.   
  
 Add the chicken livers to the pot and cook 5 minutes. Stir in the cream and parsley, and adjust seasoning if necessary. Set aside until ready to assemble lasagna.   
  
 Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.   
  
 Butter a large rectangular baking dish, then spoon 1/2-cup of meat sauce onto the bottom of the dish. Cover with 1 sheet of fresh pasta. Top the lasagna with a layer of meat sauce (making certain that pasta is completely covered), a layer of bchamel, then a light dusting of cheese. Repeat layering lasagna, sauces, and cheese in this manner until all have been used, ending with a topping of bchamel and cheese.   
  
 Bake until the lasagna is bubbling and golden brown, about 1 hour. Allow to rest 10 minutes before serving.
