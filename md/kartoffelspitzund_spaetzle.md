## Credits

by Rainer/Heidi Suletzki

## Ingredients

- 2 beef leg cross sections with marrow bone-in (beef shank?)
- 2 beef Knorr - and 1 vegetable Knorr boullion cubes
- 3 to four medium size carrots
- 1 bunch parsely
- 1/3 seleriac ( also called selery root )
- 1 package of spaetzle type noodles
- 2 lbs of potatoes ( preferably potatoes which do not fall apart when cooked )
- Salt and pepper to tast.

## Directions

Wash meet and clean it from resedue of the meat   
 slicer( in other words scrape   
 it but leave the little bit of fat attached )  
 Place in pot and cover with water ( water to be   
 approx. 2 inches above meat   
 in pot )  
 Add boullion cubes and washed parsely.  
 Skin carrots and add them to pot contents.  
 Peel seleriac, cut in chunks and add to pot.  
 Bring to boil and reduce heat to simmer, - skim   
 water surface to remove   
 impurities.  
 Simmer until meat is fork-tender ( approx 1.5   
 hours )  
  
 After one hour, prepare spaetle  
 Peel potatoes and cut in small pieces, - boil   
 them in salted water  
  
 Remove meat from broth and keep warm  
 Sift broth through a colander after removing the   
 seleriac and carrots, both   
 of which can be kept warm together with the meat.  
  
 Serve in separate bowls: Broth, Spaetzle,   
 potatoes and meat.  
  
 Here in Orono we help ourselves to a larger piece   
 of meat, cut it in smaller   
 pieces, do the same with the vegetables, add   
 broth, potatoes and Spaetzle in   
 the amounts we like.  
  
 The only variation I can think of would be to cut   
 the meat in small chunks   
 and add them to the broth before you serve the   
 dinner.  
  
 PS: Heide sometimes adds a very small amount of   
 cream to her broth, once all   
 other ingredients have been combined in the deep   
 dish at the table
