## Ingredients

- Banana Base:
- 2 ounces butter
- 1/3 cup brown sugar
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 8 ounces, bananas, very ripe, chopped into 1/2-inch pieces
- 2 tablespoons dark rum
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- Souffle:
- 2 tablespoons butter, softened
- 1/3 cup sugar, for dusting
- 12 egg whites
- 4 ounces sugar
- 2 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped into 1/4 inch chips

## Directions

To make the Banana Base: in a medium saucepan, over a high heat, brown the butter. Add the sugars and continue to cook stirring constantly until caramel color, about 5 minutes. Add the chopped bananas and stir until well coated. Continue to cook for 2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the dark rum and lemon juice. Transfer mixture to a food processor and pulse until smooth. Transfer to a bowl and allow to cool to room temperature.   
  
 Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.   
  
 Brush the inside of 6 (6-ounce) ramekins with softened butter and dust with sugar.   
  
 To make the souffle: beat the egg whites on medium speed, in a mixer with the whip attachment, to soft peaks. With the motor running, add the sugar in a slow but steady stream. Continue to whip to medium stiff peaks. With a large rubber spatula, fold 1/2 of the meringue into the Banana Base. Add the finely chopped chocolate chips and fold in the remaining 1/2 of the meringue. Fill each prepared ramekin over the top with the souffle mixture. Bake the souffles for 12 minutes. Serve immediately.
