## Ingredients

- 3 whole dried ancho chilies, stems and seeds removed (see note)
- 3 whole dried guajillo chilies, stems and seeds removed (see note)
- 2 whole chipotle peppers, canned in adobo
- 3/4 cup fresh juice from 2 to 3 oranges, preferably sour oranges
- 2 tablespoons fresh juice from 2 to 3 limes
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons Asian fish sauce
- 6 medium cloves garlic
- 1 small bunch cilantro, leaves and tender stems only, divided
- 1 tablespoon whole cumin seed, toasted and ground
- 1 teaspoon whole coriander seed, toasted and ground
- 2 tablespoons dark brown sugar
- Kosher salt
- 2 pounds skirt steak (2 to 3 whole skirt steaks), trimmed and cut with the grain into 5- to 6-inch lengths (see note)

## Directions

Place dried ancho and guajillo chilies on a microwave-safe plate and microwave
until pliable and toasty-smelling, 10 to 20 seconds. Transfer to the jar of a
blender and add chipotle peppers, orange juice, lime juice, olive oil, soy
sauce, fish sauce, garlic, cilantro, cumin seed, coriander seed, and brown
sugar. Blend until a smooth sauce has formed, about 1 minute. Season to taste
with salt. Transfer half of the salsa to a large bowl and the other half to a
sealed container. Set aside the sealed container in the refrigerator.

Add an extra 2 teaspoons of salt to the salsa in the bowl. It should taste
slightly saltier than is comfortable to taste. Add 1 piece of steak to bowl and
turn to coat. Transfer to a gallon-sized zipper-lock bag with the top folded
over to prevent excess sauce and meat juices from contaminating the seal.
Repeat with remaining steak, adding it all to the same bag. Pour any excess
marinade over the steak. Squeeze all air out of the bag and seal. Refrigerate
for at least 3 hours and up to overnight.

When ready to cook, remove the extra salsa from the fridge to allow it to warm
up a little. Light one chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal is lit
and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange the coals on one side of the
charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill, and allow to preheat
for 5 minutes. Alternatively, set half the burners on a gas grill to the
highest heat setting, cover, and preheat for 10 minutes. Clean and oil the
grilling grate.

Remove steak from marinade and wipe off excess. Place directly over the hot
side of the grill. If using a gas grill, cover; if using a charcoal grill,
leave exposed. Cook, turning occasionally, until steak is well charred on
outside and center registers 110Â°F on an instant-read thermometer, 5 to 10
minutes total. Transfer to a cutting board and allow to rest for 5 minutes.
Slice thinly against the grain and serve immediately, passing extra salsa, lime
wedges, avocado, onions, cilantro, and tortillas on the side.

## Notes

I like ancho and guajillo chilies here, but a mix of chilies such as negro,
pasilla, and California can be used in their place. An equivalent weight of
hanger or flap steak can be used in place of skirt steak.
