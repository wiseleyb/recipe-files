## Directions

Discard stems, seed, and ribs from 2 chiles and coarsely chop. Coarsely chop remaining chile including seed (for a less spicy dish, seed half of chile before chopping).  
  
 Blend chiles with remaining ingredients except chicken in a food processor until a paste forms. Cut several 1-inch-long slits in each piece of chicken, then rub paste all over chicken, rubbing it into slits. Marinate, covered and chilled, at least 2 hours.  
  
 For charcoal: Create a base that you can hold your hand over for 3-4 seconds. Cook chicken  
  
 For gas: Preheat grill. Place left burned on medium (375 or so) and turn right burner off. Cook over unlit burner, covered.  
  
 For oven: Cook - skin side up in a 450 degre oven in a 1 inch deep roasting pan for 25-30 minutes. Crisp under broiler.
