## Ingredients

- 2 cups ice cubes, plus more for serving
- 2 ounces vodka
- 2 ounces gin
- 2 ounces white rum
- 2 ounces blanco tequila
- 2 ounces triple sec
- 2 ounces maple syrup
- 2 ounces fresh lemon juice (from 1 large lemon)
- 1½ ounces fresh lime juice (from 1 lime)
- ¼ teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal), plus more to taste
- 8 ounces Coca-Cola
- Lemon and lime slices, for garnish

## Directions

In a large pitcher, combine the ice, vodka, gin, rum, tequila, triple sec,
maple syrup, lemon juice and lime juice. Add the salt, which accentuates all of
the flavors. Stir with a wooden spoon until the pitcher feels cold to the touch
and the ice has dissolved slightly, about 30 seconds. Top with the Coca-Cola.

To serve, pour the cocktail into individual glasses filled with fresh ice, and
garnish with lemon and lime slices. Sprinkle with more salt, if you’d like.
