## Directions

1 pound romaine lettuce, washed and cut into bite-sized pieces   
 Grated Parmesan cheese  
  
  
 To prepare croutons, heat the oil in a large nonstick saute pan over medium-high heat for 1 minute. Add the bread cubes, stirring and tossing in the pan to evenly coat the bread with the oil. Sprinkle in the Cajun seasoning while stirring continuously. Toast for 5 minutes, until golden brown. Reserve for garnishing the salad.   
 To make the dressing, place the anchovy and garlic into a food processor, cover, and pulse on and off several times. Add the egg, and, with the motor running, slowly add the vegetable and olive oils. Add the cheese, mustard, lemon and lime juices, water, Cajun seasoning, pepper, and salt; process briefly until ingredients are incorporated. Refrigerate until ready to use.   
  
 In a large bowl, toss romaine with the dressing, allowing approximately 3 tablespoons of the dressing per serving. Serve on chilled salad plates; top with croutons and additional Parmesan cheese. Serve immediately.  
  
  
 Angel Dust Cajun Seasoning   
  
 Combine all ingredients in a small bowl until thoroughly mixed. Store in an airtight container. The spice mix keeps its best flavor for about two months. Makes about 1/2 cup
