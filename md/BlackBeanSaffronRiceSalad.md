by Stephan Pyles

## Ingredients

- 2 tbs olive oil
- 1/2 onion, finely diced
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 cup basmati rice
- 1 1/2 cups Vegetable Stock
- Salt to taste
- 1/4 tsp saffron threads
- 1 cup cooked black beans
- 1/2 red onion, diced and blanched
- 1 small red bell pepper, seeded and diced
- 2 jalapeno chiles, seeded and minced
- 1 tbs chopped cilantro
- 1 tbs oregano
- 1/2 cup [Mango-Habanero Vinaigrette](/recipe/index.php?title=Mango-Habanero_Vinaigrette "Mango-Habanero Vinaigrette")

## Directions

In a saucepan with a lid, heat the olive oil, uncovered, until lightly smoking. Add the diced onion and saute for 1 minute over medium-high heat. Add the garlic and saute for 1 minute longer. Add the rice and stir until coated. Add the stock, salt, and saffron and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer, cover the pan, and cook until the rice has absorbed the liquid, about 15 minutes. Remove from the pan and spread out evenly on a cookie sheet. Refrigerate until cool.  
  
Transer the cooled rice to a mixing bowl and add the beans, red onion, bell pepper, chiles, cilantro, and oregano. Mix together well, add the vinaigrette, and combine thoroughly. Season with salt and server at room temperature.
