## Ingredients

- 100g (1 small) onion, grated 
- 20g (4-5 cloves) garlic, minced/pressed 
- 75g/2.6oz angel hair pasta (or Orzo), snapped into 1‚Äù/2.5cm pieces
- 175g (1c) jasmine rice, rinsed and drained until water runs clear
- 75g/6T butter
- 12g (2.5t) coarse salt 
- 20g (1T) better than bouillon (chicken) 
- 650g (2 2/3c) chicken stock
- Lemon 
- Parsley, chopped

## Directions

Heat a large heavy bottomed pot or dutch oven over medium and add butter. When
melted, add broken pasta. Fry in the butter for 2-3 minutes until the pasta is
toasted to a light golden color. Add in the rinsed rice and continue to toast
until the rice is becoming translucent, making sure to not burn the pasta. 

Add grated onions, minced garlic, and salt and continue to cook for 3-4 minutes
over medium. Add better than bouillon and chicken stock. Bring to a simmer,
reduce heat to low, cover with a lid and cook for 15 minutes.  Turn off heat
and let the pot continue to sit, covered, for 10 more minutes. 

Finish by folding in a squeeze of fresh lemon juice and chopped parsley.
