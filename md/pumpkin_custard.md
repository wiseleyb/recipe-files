## Ingredients

- 3 eggs
- 1 cup brown sugar
- 2 cups processed pumpkin (not canned)
- 1 tbs corn starch
- 1 1/4 tsp cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp ginger
- 1/8 tsp cloves
- 1/8 tsp grated nutmeg
- pinch of salt
- one can evaporated fat-free milk (12 fl oz)
- 6 custard cups
- butter
- cranberries, dark chocolate and/or whip cream for serving

## Directions

1. Three eggs - yokes and whites/ or six whites (obviously from six eggs)/ or three whites and three tsp olive oil;
2. One cup brown sugar;
3. Two cups of pumpkin - processed in some acceptable manner from a real pumpkin (not from pumpkin in a can, in other words - yuck). Mix the above - 1, 2 and 3 - in a mixing bowl. Then go to 4 ...
4. 1 tbs corn starch; 1 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp ginger; 1/8 tsp cloves and 1/8 tsp grated nutmeg and a pinch of salt - optional. Dump 4 into the mixing bowl. Then go to 5 ...
5. One can evaporated fat-free milk - that would be exactly 12 fl oz, of course. Make sure the can is dated right. Old milk tastes bad. Now go to 6 ...
6. Put the milk in the mixing bowl. Then beat everything in the mixing bowl together; and pour the contents into butter-greased Pyrex custard-cups. Six of those custard-cups should do it.
7. Then put the cups in a shallow pan filled with one-inch of water.
8. The oven temperature should set at 350 degrees. Bake for no more than forty-five minutes.

You will enjoy the pudding either with cranberries and whipped-cream or with shaved dark-chocolate and whipped-cream.

Don't eat the pudding when it's hot. You might burn your tongue. Let it cool first.

## History

From Norman:

Although I invented the recipe and participate in the occasional fabrication of it, Anita bakes it - her baking skills being superior.

The contents of this pumpkin CUSTARD are the same as for our pumpkin PIE. And the pumpkin variety we use is what we grow organically in our own garden - definitely in our opinion the best tasting variety for custard, pie, bread, muffins and in hearty winter stews.

The variety is LONG PIE - and is probably a rather ancient Native American variety. In more modern times, though, the seed is said to have migrated around 1832 from the Isle of St. George in the Azores to Nantucket on a whaling ship, and hence to Maine where it became popular for pie; but then nearly forgotten and almost extinct.

However, a Maine farmer, at that point, moving to Montana, to be a cowboy in the cattle-business there, inadvertently took seed with him in a saddle bag. After that, lucky things began to happen for the Long Pie variety and seed is now available from several commercial sources. The mature fruit looks like a fat, overripe zucchini.
