## Ingredients

- 30 ounces (1 quart plus a little extra) fresh strawberries, washed, hulled,
  and divided (see notes)
- 1 1/4 cups sugar, divided
- 4 tablespoons 80-proof liquor such as vodka or, preferably, Cointreau
- 2 cups half-and-half
- 1/2 cup corn syrup
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, to taste
- Scant drops of lemon juice, if needed

## Directions

Quarter 6 ounces (about 1 cup) strawberries, then slice quarters crosswise into
very thin pieces. In a mixing bowl, combine strawberries with 1/2 cup sugar and
alcohol and let stand in refrigerator for at least 2 hours and up to 2 days.

In a countertop blender, process remaining strawberries until very smooth,
about 30 seconds. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer to filter out all seeds
and fibers, then measure and reserve 1 1/2 cups purée. Extra purée, if there is
any, can be put to another use.

In a clean mixing bowl, whisk together 1 1/2 cups strawberry purée with
half-and-half, corn syrup, and remaining 3/4 cup sugar until fully combined.
Add salt to taste, and, if mixture is too sweet, a few drops of lemon juice.

Chill in refrigerator or ice bath until base is very cold, at least 45°F (7°C),
then churn in ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions. In the
last minute of churning, retrieve strawberry mix-ins from the refrigerator,
strain off syrup, and add mix-ins to the churn; reserve strawberry syrup for
another use (it makes a great daiquiri). Transfer ice cream to airtight
container and chill in freezer for at least 4 hours before serving.

## Notes

I only used 1 cup sugar... could probably use less.
