## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups dried red kidney beans, soaked overnight and drained 
- 2 cloves garlic, smashed 
- 1/2 cup unsweetened coconut milk 
- 3 green onions, thinly sliced, plus more for garnish 
- 1 Scotch bonnet pepper, chopped 
- 3 sprigs fresh thyme 
- 1 1/2 cups long grain rice 
- Salt and freshly ground pepper

## Directions

Place beans and garlic in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring to a simmer and cook until the beans are tender, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours. When the beans are tender, stir in the coconut milk, green onions, Scotch bonnet, and thyme, and increase the heat to a boil. Stir in the rice, cover the pot, and cook until the rice is tender and has absorbed most of the liquid. Transfer to a large serving bowl and garnish with sliced green onions.
