## Ingredients

- 1 cups graham cracker crumbs
- cup all purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons baking powder
- 1 can (14 oz.) condensed milk (not Evaporated milk) 
- cup softened butter (note: you can substitute 1 cup of vanilla yogurt and it works just as well - you need to, however, add 1 full cup of flour, not cup. Also, if you use this, try not to use non-fat yogurt) 
- 1 cups flaked coconut
- 1 package (12 oz.) chocolate chips (I have used milk chocolate, semi-sweet and white chocolate at different times. All are yummy) 
- 1 cup chopped nuts (pecans, walnuts and especially macadamia nuts all work great. I have no preference between these. I suppose you could use peanuts, but I don't like peanuts so I have never tried.)

## Directions

The best damn chocolate chip cookies

Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. In one bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, flour and backing powder. In another bowl, beat together the butter and the condensed milk. Add dry ingredients mixture and mix well. Stir in the coconut, the chocolate chips and the chopped nuts. Drop by rounded tablespoons onto ungreased cooking sheet (although I always use silpat). Bake 9 to 12 minutes or until lightly browned.

I am not sure which combo I like better: white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts, or milk chocolate and pecans.
