# Roast Turkey With Bacon

There's a reason people only eat Turkey once a year, although, given modern culinary options I'm not even sure why it's that frequent. One of the many problems with cooking a 20lb bird is that all their [not-so-noodly-appendages](http://www.venganza.org/ "http://www.venganza.org/") have different cooking times. Cook the thighs and you've got bone dry breasts, cook the breasts just so and you've got bloody legs, etc... it's a B grade horror movie that only [Harold McGee](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684843285/102-1422794-7281716?v=glance&n=283155&v=glance "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684843285/102-1422794-7281716?v=glance&n=283155&v=glance") could find entertaining. There are a number of solutions to this, the one we use is great. Not only does it involve using paper towels to maneuver a 20lb, 400 degree object numerous times during cooking, but it includes **bacon!**

We're currently at the end of the earth in [lovely Tofino, Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada](http://www.island.net/~tofino/indexpic.jpg "http://www.island.net/~tofino/indexpic.jpg") (don't worry, they've taken up our Friday shopping extravaganza and put all 10 shops in town on a 40%-off sale for Friday only). We've adapted this recipe for the bacontarian on holiday in a hostile foreign land, like Canada.

**Step one** of our [Roast\_Turkey starting point recipe](/recipe/index.php?title=Roast_Turkey_starting_point_recipe&action=edit "Roast Turkey starting point recipe") calls for brining the beast. Now, you need a bloody big pot to brine a 20lb creature, no matter how plucked they are. But, we respect brining, mandatory soaking in salt is always a good sign that the product your cooking leaves just about everything to be desired. Since we didn't have room for a 10 gallon stock pot (yah, we've got one of those) in our fuel efficient VW Golf we decided to take an alternate path... we are, of course, steps from the Pacific Ocean. And, matey, there's rumored to be salt in them thar waters. Avast... keel haul the creature! (more on this silliness [here](http://mudabone.com/aietc/2005/11/tofino-brining-turkey.html "http://mudabone.com/aietc/2005/11/tofino-brining-turkey.html") and [here](http://www.suletzki.com/default.aspx?id=197 "http://www.suletzki.com/default.aspx?id=197")).

**Step two** - if keel hauling in the Pacific Ocean, wash sand out.

**Step three** - cook the bird breast side down for 30 minutes at 400 degrees.&nbsp; Yawn...

**Step four**... decision time (and it's not a hard one). First, using paper towels, flip the bird breast side up. Wasn't that fun? How badly did you burn yourself? Paper towels absord and that things spurting juices... who thought this up.&nbsp; Want to do that 3 more times? Hell no! Abandon thee recipe! Beyond here thar be dragons.

The breast is going to dry out if we cook the thighs through.... what to do? Cover the fowl in Bacon, like so...

<small>mmmm... bacon</small>

Cook until bacon is done (who cares about the stupid bird). It should look something like this...

Put the non-flying creature back in the oven and cook it some more (to crisp up the skin, the only worthy part of this whole creature) while fending off friends and family who will attempt to eat all the bacon you've spent half the day cooking.

Chop up remaining bacon and put it in the mashers (make sure there is plenty of creme and butter in those thar mashers) ... yum. Serve turkey as an after thought or a side dish.

We hope you've enjoyed our method of cooking bacon.
