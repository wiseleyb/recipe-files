## Ingredients

- 1 recipe [Achiote Citrus Marinade](/recipe/index.php?title=Achiote_Citrus_Marinade "Achiote Citrus Marinade")
- 1 1/2 pounds chicken legs and thighs 
- 24 small corn tortillas
- 1 recipe [Salsa Fresca](/recipe/index.php?title=Salsa_Fresca "Salsa Fresca")
- 2 avocados, peeled and sliced 
- 1/2 bunch cilantro, leaves only, chopped

## Directions

Rub the marinade all over the chicken pieces. Place in a bowl, cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour or as long as overnight. Preheat the oven to 350/. Lift the chicken pieces from the marinade and transfer to a roasting pan. Roast for about 40 minutes, or until the meat easily pulls away from the bone. Set the chicken aside to cool and pour the cooking juices from the pan into a bowl or cup.   
  
Refrigerate the juices so that the fat rises to the top. When the chicken is cool, remove and discard the skin, if desired, and bones and cut or shred the meat into bitesized pieces. Refrigerate the chicken if you do not plan to use it right away. When you are ready to make the tacos, skim off and discard the fat which has risen from the cooking juices, and use the brown cooking liquid which remains to reheat the chicken in a low oven.   
  
Dip a corn tortilla in some water and shake off the excess. Toast one at a time in a nonstick pan over medium heat for about 1 minute on each side. Wrap in a towel to keep warm while you dip and heat the remaining tortillas.   
  
For each taco, stack 2 tortillas. Divide the warm chicken and place on top. Top with Salsa Fresca, sliced avocado, and chopped cilantro.
