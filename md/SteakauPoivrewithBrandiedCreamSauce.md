## Ingredients

- sauce
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 medium shallot, minced (about 3 tablespoons)
- 1 cup canned low-sodium beef broth
- 3/4 cup canned low-sodium chicken broth
- 1/4 cup heavy cream 
- 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon brandy 
- 1 teaspoon juice from 1 lemon or 1 teaspoon champagne vinegar 
- Salt 
- 4 strip steaks (8 to 10 ounces each), to 1 inch thick, trimmed of exterior gristle
- Salt
- 1 tablespoon black peppercorns, crushed

## Directions

1. Heat 1 tablespoon butter in 12-inch heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat; when foaming subsides, add shallot and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 2 minutes. Add beef and chicken broths, increase heat to high, and boil until reduced to about cup, about 8 minutes. Set reduced broth mixture aside. Rinse and wipe out skillet.   
  
 2. Meanwhile, sprinkle both sides of steaks with salt; rub one side of each steak with 1 teaspoon crushed peppercorns, and, using fingers, press peppercorns into steaks.  
  
 3. Place now-empty skillet over medium heat until hot, about 4 minutes. Lay steaks unpeppered-side down in hot skillet, increase heat to medium-high, firmly press down on steaks with bottom of cake pan, and cook steaks without moving them until well-browned, about 6 minutes. Using tongs, flip steaks, firmly press down on steaks with bottom of cake pan, and cook on peppered side, about 3 minutes for rare, about 4 minutes for medium-rare, or about 5 minutes for medium. Transfer steaks to large plate and tent loosely with foil to keep warm.  
  
 4. Pour reduced broth, cream, and 1/4 cup brandy into now-empty skillet; increase heat to high and bring to boil, scraping pan bottom with wooden spoon to loosen browned bits. Simmer until deep golden brown and thick enough to heavily coat back of metal tablespoon or soup spoon, about 5 minutes. Off heat, whisk in remaining 3 tablespoons butter, remaining 1 tablespoon brandy, lemon juice or vinegar, and any accumulated meat juices. Adjust seasonings with salt.   
  
 5. Set steaks on individual dinner plates, spoon portion of sauce over steaks, and serve immediately.

To save time, crush the peppercorns and trim the steaks while the broth mixture simmers. Many pepper mills do not have a sufficiently coarse setting. In that case, crush peppercorns with a saut pan or rolling pin.
