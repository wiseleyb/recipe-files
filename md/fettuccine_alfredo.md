## Ingredients

**Pasta Dough**

- See [Fresh Pasta](https://github.com/wiseleyb/recipe-files/blob/master/md/pasta.md)

**Alfredo sauce**

- 5 ounces (140g) grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, plus more for sprinkling
- 2 tablespoons (30ml) heavy cream
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon (3g) cornstarch
- 2 tablespoons (30ml) extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving
- 1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest (optional)
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1 pound (449g) fresh fettuccine, or 12 ounces (340g) dried fettuccine
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic (about 1 medium clove)
- 2 tablespoons (30g) unsalted butter
- Minced fresh parsley or chives


## Directions

- Combine cheese, heavy cream, egg, cornstarch, olive oil, and lemon zest (if
  using) in a large bowl. Season lightly with salt and heavily with black
  pepper and whisk to combine. Set aside.
- Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add pasta and
  cook, stirring frequently to prevent sticking, until cooked but still very
  firm (not quite al dente), about 45 seconds for fresh pasta or 1 minute less
  than package directions indicate for dried pasta. Drain pasta into a colander
  set over a large bowl. Transfer 2 cups (480ml) of cooking water to a liquid
  measuring cup and discard the rest. Transfer pasta to the now-empty bowl. Add
  garlic and butter and toss to coat.
- Whisking constantly, slowly add 1 1/2 cups of pasta cooking water to bowl
  with cheese mixture. Transfer cheese mixture to the now-empty pasta cooking
  pot, scraping the bottom to make sure you get everything. Cook over
  medium-high heat, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula, until mixture
  comes to a boil and thickens, about 45 seconds. Season sauce to taste with
  more salt and pepper as desired. Transfer pasta to sauce mixture and turn to
  coat. Just before serving, stir in more pasta water to thin sauce out as
  necessary. Serve immediately, sprinkled with minced herbs, black pepper, and
  cheese, and drizzled with additional olive oil.

## Notes

The fresh pasta makes enough fettuccine for 4-5 people as does the Alfredo
sauce. If you're cooking for one you can freeze pasta dough and the left over
sauce (pre-adding pasta water) will keep for a few days.
