by Heidi Suletzki

## Ingredients

- 5 large Eggs 
- 200 gramm all-purpose flour 
- 100 gramm butter or margarine
- 2 tablespoons sugar 
- 1/2 teaspoon salt 
- 1/4 liter sourcream or 1/8 liter milk

## Directions

Beat: flour, eggs, sugar, salt, sourcream or milk   
 together, a kind of heavy  
 batter. Melt butter/margarine and add. You could   
 separate the eggs and beat  
 the eggwhites and then fold them into the batter,   
 either way. With the   
 beaten  
 egg-whites the batter is less heavy and tends to   
 separate at times.
