## Ingredients

- [Sushi Rice](/md/sushi_rice.md)
- [Teriyaki Sauce](/md/teriyaki_sauce.md)
- Chicken, Salmon, Tofu, Steak, etc for a protein
- Misc vegetables: Cucumber, Snow Peas, Carrots, Brocolli, Bell Peppers, Green Onions, pretty much anything

## Directions

This is all personal - do whatever you want but my weekly prep for this:

Make sushi-rice - it reheats in the microwave easily - or is good cold

Grill up chicken in just salt and pepper. Slice, devide into portions.

For vegatables... I like to keep some raw for a cooling taste (I make my teriyaki sauce super spicy) and others I saute very briefly.

For prepping veg... I do julienne cut most of it (which is like making match-sticks)

Putting together:
- heat up rice if needed/desired
- on medium-high heat very briefly saute protein and veggies in teriyaki sauce
- serve in bowl with hot stuff on one side and raw veggies on the other.
- Garnish with green-onions or anything else
