## Directions

Dice the mushroom caps and reserve in the refridgerator, covered with a damp towel.  
  
 To prepare the mushroom broth, place the mushroom stems, dried mushrooms, scallions, garlic, onion, leek, thyme, peppercorns, wine and 4 cups of water in a stockpot and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer and let the broth simmer for 1 hour. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve or cheesecloth into a large clean saucepan and return to a simmer. Add more water if necessary to yield 5 cups.  
  
 Meanwhile, to prepare the risotto, place the olive oil in a heavy saucepan set over high heat. When lightly smoking, add the onion and saute for 1 miute. Add the garlic and continue to cook for 1 minute. Reduce the heat to medium and add the rice, stirring for 1 minute, making sure each grain is coated with oil. Add the white wine and cook until it is completely absorbed. Continue adding the broth in 1/2-cup incrememnts until 1 cup of broth remains, stirring until each addition is absorbed. The rice should be almost tender but still a bit al dente, about 25 minutes in all.  
  
 Add teh reserved mushrooms and 3/4 cup of the remaining broth. Cook until the mushrooms are cooked through and the liquid is absordbed, while continuing to stir. Add the herbs, butter, and the remaining 1/4 cup of broth. Season with salt and pepper and remove the heat. Stir in cheese and serve.
