### Filling
- 8 shiitake mushrooms, stems discarded, minced
- 1 tsp cornstarch
- 2 tsp dry sherry
- 2 tsp water
- salt and pepper
- 1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken - chopped
- 5 Tbsp oil
- 1 tsp fresh minced ginger
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 green onions, minced
- 2 small dried chilis, minced (optional)
- 8 oz can bamboo shoots, minced
- 8 oz can water chestnuts, minced

### Cooking Sauce:
- 1 Tbsp Hoisin sauce
- 1 Tbsp soy sauce
- 1 Tbsp dry sherry
- 2 Tbsp oyster sauce
- 2 Tbsp water
- 1 tsp. sesame oil
- 1 tsp. sugar
- 2 tsp. cornstarch

### For putting it together
- 1 package cellophane Chinese rice noodles 
- 2 heads iceberg lettuce

## Directions

Iceberg lettuce "cups" leaves. You can do this by coring the Iceberg like you would a strawberry, cutting in half, and very carefully peeling off layers.

Mix all ingredients for cooking sauce in bowl, and set aside. In medium bowl, combine cornstarch, sherry water, soy sauce, salt, pepper, and chicken. Stir to coat chicken thoroughly.  
  
Stir in 1 tsp. oil and let sit 15 minutes to marinate. Heat wok or large skillet over medium high heat. Add 3 Tbsp oil, then add chicken and stir fry for about 3-4 minutes. Set aside. Add 2 Tbsp oil to pan. Add ginger, garlic, chilies (if desired), and onion; stir fry about a minute or so. Add mushrooms, bamboo shoots and water chestnuts; stir fry an additional 2 minutes. Return chicken to pan.  
  
Add mixed cooking sauce to pan. Cook until thickened and hot. 

Heat a cup or so of oil to around 400F in a small pan. Add rice noodles to hot oil and they should puff up. Remove after a few second.

To eat: place some cooked chicken mixture and some rice noodles in a lettuce cup and eat sort of like a taco.
