## Ingredients

- 4 ripe tomatoes
- 1/4 red onion, minced 
- 2 jalapeno chiles, stemmed, seeded and minced 
- 1 bunch cilantro, leaves only chopped 
- 2 tablespoons lime juice 
- 3/4 teaspoon salt 
- pinch of freshly ground black pepper

## Directions

In a mixing bowl combine all the ingredients. Stir and toss well. Store in a covered container in the refrigerator no more than 1 day.

We've found that you can't really store this for more than 15 minutes or so before it becomes soup... but, for those 15 minutes - it's the best salsa in the world.
