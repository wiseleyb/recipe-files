## Ingredients

**Dough**

- 1 tsp sugar
- package dry yeast
- 1 cup warm water (100-110 degrees)
- 2.75 cups all purpose flour
- 1/4 cup whole wheat flour
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 2 tbs olive oil

**Topping**

- package italian sausage (casing removed, browned, crumbled)
- about 1 cup Classico Basil-Tomatoe sauce
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- mushrooms
- salami/peperoni (saute'd, cuts down on greese)
- 1 tbs tomatoe paste
- 1 tsp oregano
- 1/4 tsp fennel seeds, crushed
- corn meal
- about 2 cups shredded mozzarella
- 2 tbs parmesan

## Directions

**For the dough**  
Activate yeast in warm water with sugar in the bottom of your stand mixer bowl for 5 minutes or so. Start mixing in 1 cup of flour and slowly add remaining flour (the dough might not take all the flour called for). Whole wheat flour is optional but I think it makes the dough better. Add olive oil early on. When dough comes together stop the mixer and let it rest for 15 minutes. Add salt and finish mixing until your dough is elastic (window panes, etc., this isn't a baking guide).

**For the sauce**  
You can make your own but I think Classico's Tomatoe Basil is an excellent base. To this add garlic (sauted), oregano, fennel seeds, maybe some red pepper flakes and cook for 20 minutes to bring the flavors together. I usually add a 1/2 cup of water and then cook it back out until I have a consistancy I like.

**For toppings**  
I like to saute the sausage and salami/pepperoni first to reduce the amount of greese in the pizza. Given the cooking time this probably isn't crucial though.

**Put it together** After you dough has risen, been punched down and risen again form it into a disc and put it in an oiled cast iron pan with some corn meal (to help you get it out again). I might loose the cornmeal and really oil the pan next time (maybe even do the Pizza Hut method of crisco) and see how that works.

Bake at 375 for 40-50 minutes, until it looks done.

I tried this [recipe](http://www.pizzamaking.com/deepdish.php "http://www.pizzamaking.com/deepdish.php") and I'm not sure I'm crazy about it. More work to be done.
