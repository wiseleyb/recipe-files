## Directions

**For sauce**

Standard sauce recipe... saute onions, then garlic, then add everything. Let reduce A LOT. You want a really thick sauce for deep dish.

**For the dough**

Add dry ingredients, combine. Add wet ingredients, mix 5-10 minutes. Put in fridge to slow rise for 24 hours or so. Remove from fridge, devide in two if using full dough recipe. Knead with flour, allow to rise for a few hours again. Turn dough onto floured surface and roll into a rectangle. Spread a layer of butter, fold in 1/3s, pinch seal closed. Form into a ball. Let rise in fridge for and hour (to harden butter). Remove and roll into a disk that will fit in your pan. Button the bottom of the pan. Place dough in pan. Then build pizza in "reverse". Add cheese. Meat (I cook mine first, but lots of people say not to). Then sauce. Trim excess dough. Back at 375 for 40-50 minutes. Let rest 10 minutes before cutting.
