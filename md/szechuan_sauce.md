## Ingredients

- 1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons maple syrup or brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch (see notes)
- 1 tablespoon chili garlic sauce
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- 1/2 teaspoon Chinese five spice powder
- 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- fresh garlic or 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- fresh ginger or 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger

## Directions

Mix in a bowl - add to whatever you're making.

## Notes

If you're doing something with chicken/pork/etc you can coat the meat before
sauce in cornstarch. It gives a nice brown crust and thickens the sauce.
