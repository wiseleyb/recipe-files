## Ingredients

- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons maple syrup or brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch (see notes)
- 1 tablespoon chili garlic sauce
- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
- 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- fresh garlic
- fresh ginger

## Directions

Mix in a bowl for a more textured sauce or put it all in food processor or belnder to a more consistent sauce - add t  whatever you're making.

## Notes

If you're doing something with chicken/pork/tofu/etc. you can coat it before saute in cornstarch. It gives a nice brown crust and thickens the sauce.
