## Directions

For Dry Rub:  
Place all ingredients into a food processor and process until well blended. Transfer, label, wrap tightly and store at room temperature for service.  
  
For Salmon:  
Place salmon steaks on wax paper a couple hours prior to cooking. Sprinkle both sides of the salmon flesh, evenly with the fish dry rub (1 tsp. per serving). Press the seasonings into the salmon flesh. Refrigerate salmon steaks, uncovered, for at least 2 hours and up to 12 hours before using.  
  
Place salmon pieces onto the center of the cedar plank. Meanwhile, toss to coat the plank vegetables in a bowl with the lemon juice, olive oil, parsley, garlic, salt and pepper. Transfer and place the vegetables around the salmon. Squeeze the lemon over the top of the salmon. Place cedar plank into a 375-degree pre-heated oven. Bake for 8-10 minutes and pull from the oven, turn the salmon over, place back in the oven and cook for an additional 8-10 minutes or until an internal temperature of 120 degrees is achieved in the salmon fillet. Remove cedar plank from oven and serve.
