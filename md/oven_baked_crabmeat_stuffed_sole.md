## Ingredients

- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- 2 tablespoons minced red bell pepper
- 2 tablespoons minced green onion
- 1 tablespoon minced celery
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- 1 cup lump crabmeat, picked through for shells and cartilage
- 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice, plus 2 tablespoons
- Salt and white pepper
- 4 (5 to 6 ounce) sole fillets 
- [Meuniere Sauce](/recipe/index.php?title=Meuniere_Sauce "Meuniere Sauce")

## Directions

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

Heat olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Add bell pepper, green onion, celery, and 1 teaspoon of minced garlic. Saute until softened, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and cool slightly. In a medium bowl, combine cooled vegetables, crabmeat, and 2 teaspoons of lemon juice. Season crab mixture with salt and white pepper, to taste.

Season sole fillets with salt and pepper on both sides. Spoon crabmeat mixture down the center of the fillets and roll lengthwise into bundles. Using toothpicks, secure the ends so that the fillets won't unwrap during baking. Place sole fillet bundles, seam-side down, in a lightly greased 9-inch square baking dish. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through.

Pour warm [Meuniere Sauce](/recipe/index.php?title=Meuniere_Sauce "Meuniere Sauce") over crabmeat stuffed sole and serve immediately.
