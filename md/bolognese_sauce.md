## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 4 tablespoons butter
- 2/3 pound ground lamb (or 85/15 ground beef)
- 2/3 pound ground pork
- 2/3 pound ground veal
- 4 ounces chicken livers, finely chopped (optional)
- 1 large onion, finely chopped (about 1 1/2 cups)
- 2 large carrots, peeled, and cut into 1/4-inch dice (about 1 cup)
- 3 large ribs celery, peeled, and cut into 1/4-inch dice (about 1 cup)
- 4 cloves garlic, finely minced, or grated on a microplane grater
- 1/2 cup fresh sage leaves, finely chopped
- large pinch red pepper flakes (optional)
- 1 (28-ounce) can crushed Italian plum tomatoes, preferably D.O.P. San Marzano
- 1 1/2 cups dry red wine (white works fine as well)
- 1 1/2 cups whole milk
- 2 cups homemade chicken or veal stock (or 2 cups low-sodium canned chicken broth)
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 tablespoon Vietnamese or Thai fish sauce
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1/2 cup minced basil or parsley (or a mix of both)

## Directions

Heat butter and olive oil in large Dutch Oven over high heat, stirring
occasionally, until butter has stopped foaming. Add lamb, pork, veal, and
chicken livers, and cook, breaking up meat with wooden spoon, until no longer
pink, 7-10 minutes. Remove from heat, transfer meat to strainer set in large
bowl, allow to drain, then transfer drained liquid back to Dutch Oven. Add
onions, carrots, celery, garlic, sage, and red pepper flakes, and set over
medium heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are softened, but not
browned, about 10 minutes.

Return meat to skillet, add tomatoes, wine, milk, stock, and bay leaves, and
bring to a simmer over high heat. Reduce heat to low, partially cover, and
simmer 2 1/2 to 3 hours, stirring occasionally, until liquid is slightly below
level of meat, about 2 quarts of sauce total (you may need to add excess stock
while cooking if your burner is cooking it too hot). A layer of fat may form on
top during cooking, but do not skim it off. After cooking, remove bay leaves,
add fish sauce and heavy cream and simmer until fat is emulsified, about five
minutes. Season to taste with salt and black pepper. Remove from heat and
allow to cool at room temperature for 30 minutes. Stir in parsley and basil.

Bolognese will keep for up to 1 week in fridge, and will improve with time.

## Notes

I don't add nearly this much dairy but add more tomotoes (for use with normal pasta, this is for lasagna)
