## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
- 2 medium white onions, diced 
- 2 garlic cloves, minced 
- 2 jalapenos, seeded and minced 
- 3 ripe medium tomatoes, chopped 
- 1 quart chicken stock, recipe follows 
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper 
- Canola oil, for pan-frying 
- 8 corn tortillas, cut into 1/8-inch-thick strips 
- 1 1/2 cups shredded cooked chicken 
- 2 avocados, halved, pitted, peeled, and diced 
- 1 cup shredded Jack cheese, optional 
- 1/2 cup coarsely chopped fresh cilantro leaves, for garnish 
- 1 lime, cut in wedges, for serving

## Directions

Place a stockpot over medium heat and coat with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Add the onions, garlic, jalapenos, and tomatoes; cook, stirring for 15 minutes until the vegetables are cooked down and pulpy. Pour in the stock, season with salt and pepper, and simmer for 20 minutes.   
 Meanwhile, heat 1-inch of canola oil in a skillet over medium-high flame. When the oil begins to smoke, add the tortilla strips in batches and fry until they are crisp on all sides. Remove to a paper towel-lined platter and sprinkle with salt while they are still hot.   
  
 Ladle the hot soup into 4 soup bowls and put a pile of shredded chicken on top of each. Top with the diced avocado and fried tortilla strips (and cheese if using). Garnish with cilantro and serve with lime wedges.
