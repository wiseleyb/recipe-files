## Ingredients

- 8 Halibut filets 
- Portobello Crust 
- 1.5 Tablespoon olive oil 
- 2 teaspoons garlic, chopped 
- 1/2 cup Spanish onion, sliced 
- 1/2 cup red wine 
- 4-5 Portobello mushroom caps, coarsely chopped 
- 1/4 cup dried or frozen porcini mushrooms, coarsely chopped 
- 1/2 cup button mushrooms, coarsely chopped 
- 1 teaspoon fresh rosemary leaves 
- 1/4 cup heavy cream
- Grilled Portobellos
- 6 whole medium Portobello mushroom caps 
- 3.5 Tablespoons olive oil 
- Kosher or sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

## Directions

Portobello Crust:  
 Heat olive oil in a large saut pan over high heat. Add onion and garlic and sweat until translucent, about 3-5 minutes. Deglaze with the red wine. Add the mushrooms and cook until soft, about 8-10 minutes. Add the rosemary and heavy cream and cook until slightly reduced, about 3-4 minutes. Transfer to a food processor fitted with a steel blade and pulse until it has the consistency of thick mud.  
  
 Grilled Portobellos:  
 Prepare grill to medium-high heat. In a medium bowl, toss mushroom caps with olive oil, salt and pepper. Place on a grill and cook on both sides for 2-3 minutes, or until softened and juices begin to release. Remove from grill and set aside.  
  
 Halibut:  
 Preheat oven to 450F. Smear 1-2 tablespoons of mushroom pure onto each halibut filet. Thinly slice mushroom caps on an angle (for thin wide slices), and then layer on top of mushroom pure in a "shingle" fashion. Place filets on sheet pan and roast in oven 10-12 minutes.
