## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons plus 1/2 cup canola oil 
- 1 red onion, coarsely chopped 
- 3 cloves garlic, chopped 
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh ginger 
- 1 serrano chile, coarsely chopped 
- 2 tablespoons green curry paste 
- 3 ripe mangoes, peeled, pitted, and coarsely chopped 
- 2 cups water 
- 3 tablespoons fresh lime juice 
- 3 tablespoons chopped cilantro leaves 
- 1 tablespoon honey 
- Salt and freshly ground pepper

## Directions

Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and cook until soft, about 3 minutes. Add garlic, ginger, and serrano chile and cook for 1 minute. Add the curry paste and cook for 2 minutes. Add mangoes and water, stir well, and cook until the mango is soft, about 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a blender (see \*Cook's Note below). Add the lime juice, cilantro, and honey and blend until smooth. With the motor running, slowly add the remaining 1/2 cup oil and blend until emulsified. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.   
Cook's Note: When blending hot liquids, remove liquid from the heat and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes. Transfer liquid to a blender or food processor and fill it no more than halfway. If using a blender, release 1 corner of the lid. This prevents the vacuum effect that creates heat explosions. Place a towel over the top of the machine, pulse a few times, and then process on high speed until smooth.
