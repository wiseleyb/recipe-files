## Ingredients

- [Achiote Citrus Marinade](/recipe/index.php?title=Achiote_Citrus_Marinade "Achiote Citrus Marinade")
- 1 (3-pound) roasting chicken, rinsed and patted dry 
- 1 onion, peeled 
- 1 head garlic 
- 1 orange

## Directions

Rub the marinade all over the chicken, inside and out. Place in a bowl, cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour or as long as overnight.   
  
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.   
  
Lift the chicken from the marinade and place on a work surface. Cut the onion, head of garlic and orange in half and stuff inside the chicken's cavity. Tie the legs together and place on a rack in a roasting pan, breast side down.   
  
Roast 20 minutes, then reduce the heat to 350 degrees and roast 20 minutes longer. Turn the chicken, breast side up, and bake 40 to 50 minutes longer, basting occasionally with the pan juices, until a drumstick feels loose when jiggled and the skin is golden brown. Remove from the oven and let sit 10 minutes before serving. Serve warm with rice and beans.
