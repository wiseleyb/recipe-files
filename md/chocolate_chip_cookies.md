## Ingredients

- 3/4 cups all purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1/3 cup brown sugar, packed
- 1 large eggs
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 cups old fashioned oats
- 1 bag Chocolate Chips

## Directions

Preheat oven to 375F. Prepare baking sheets with silpat or parchment paper.

In medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside. Melt
your butter and let cool slightly.

In the mixing bowl of your stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat
together the melted butter, sugar, brown sugar, eggs, and vanilla. Add the
flour, baking soda, and salt, and mix until just combined. Using a rubber
spatula, fold in the oats, and chips.

Using a cookie scoop, scoop dough onto prepared baking sheets. Bake for about
9-11 minutes, or until edges or golden brown. Cool on cookie sheet for 5
minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
