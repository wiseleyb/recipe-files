## Ingredients

- For dipping sauce:
- 2 cups soy sauce
- 2 cups seasoned rice vinegar 
- 1/2 cup minced ginger
- 1 1/4 cup sesame oil
- 2 tablespoons chili oil
- 2 tablespoons granulated white sugar 
- For rolls:
- 4 ounce uncooked rice vermicelli
- 3 cups snow peas, sliced thin
- 4 cups peeled and julienned carrots
- 1 julienned jalapeo chile 
- 8 cups shredded Napa cabbage
- 4 cups seeded, deveined, and julienned red bell pepper
- 4 cups green onions, cleaned and minced
- 1 bunch basil
- 1 bunch cilantro
- 1 bunch mint
- 35 dry rice spring roll wrappers

## Directions

In a non-metallic bowl, combine all the ingredients for the dipping sauce. Set aside.   
  
 Soften the noodles by immersing in boiling water for 2 to 3 minutes. Drain well. Bring a pot of water to boil. Blanch the snow peas and then shock them in an ice bath. Drain and set aside.   
  
 Combine all the vegetables with 1/2 cup of the sauce. Check for seasoning.   
  
 Wash and pick off the leaves of the basil, cilantro, and the mint.   
  
 Dampen a stack of tea towels. Carefully mist the spring roll wrappers one at a time and separate each of them with a damp tea towel. Allow to rest about 5 minutes.   
  
 Carefully peel off the wrappers, one at a time, and lay on a clean work surface in front of you. Place 3 cilantro leaves, 2 mint leaves, and 1 basil leaf on the wrapper.   
  
 Drain the vegetables. Place a small pile of vegetables and a small amount of the softened noodles on top of the leaves.   
  
 Tuck in the sides of the roll and roll up tight, like a burrito. Cover the finished rolls with another damp tea towel and wrap tightly with plastic. Serve immediately with dipping sauce.
