## Ingredients

- 1 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes
- 10 cloves garlic (peeled and crushed)
- 3 anchovy fillets (packed in oil )
- 8 Tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (plus more for serving)
- Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
- Finely grated Parmesan (for serving)

## Directions

Preheat oven to 425°F.

Crush the tomatoes with your hands and add them, and their juices to a 13×9”
baking dish, along with the garlic, anchovies, butter, and ½ teaspoon red
pepper flakes. Season with salt and pepper. Roast, tossing halfway through,
until the garlic has softened, and the liquid has reduced, approximately 40-45
minutes.

Use a fork, or potato masher, to break up the tomatoes and garlic.

Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling, salted water, until al dente. Drain,
reserving ½ cup of the pasta coking water. Return pasta to pot and add tomato
sauce, and reserved cooking water. Cook over medium-high heat, tossing the
pasta and sauce, until pasta is well coated, about 3 minutes.

Serve topped with parmesan cheese, and additional red pepper flakes, if
desired.
