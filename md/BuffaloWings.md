## Ingredients

- 2 quarts canola oil or crisco 
- 3 1/2 pounds chicken wings, cut into three pieces, wing tips reserved for another use 
- 1/2 stick (4 tablespoons) unsalted butter 
- 1 cup Franks Red Hot sauce 
- 2 1/2 teaspoons Tabasco sauce 
- 1 1/2 teaspoons cayenne pepper 
- Celery sticks
- Blue Cheese Dressing

- 1/4 cup buttermilk

- 1/4 cup mayonnaise 
- 1/4 lemon, juiced, or to taste 
- Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper

## Directions

Heat oil to 400 degrees F in a deep fryer or a medium stockpot. Line a baking sheet with paper towels; set aside. Add half of the wing pieces to hot oil and fry until dark golden brown, 15 to 25 minutes. Transfer to prepared baking sheets to drain.   
  
 While wings are cooking, melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add hot sauce, Tabasco, and cayenne pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until hot. Lower heat and keep warm until ready to use.   
  
 When the first batch of wings finishes cooking, transfer to an airtight container. Add half of the sauce and cover tightly. Shake container to fully coat wings in sauce. Serve immediately with Blue Cheese Dressing and celery sticks. Repeat with remaining wings and sauce.
