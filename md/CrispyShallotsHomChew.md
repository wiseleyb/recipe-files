## Ingredients

- 10-15 shallots, sliced into paper-thin rings (1 cup)
- 2 cups vegetable oil
- Sea salt

## Directions

Separate the shallots into individual strands and rings. In a 10-inch skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat for 2 minutes, or until it is very hot but not smoking. Add the shallots and cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, until the shallots slowly brown to golden, 15-20 minutes. If the oil begins to dance and splatter, lower the heat and sprinkle a few pinches of sea salt. Remove from the heat. Put a strainer over a large metal mixing bowl and drain the shallots in the strainer. Transfer the shallots to a cookie sheet lined with paper towels. When completely cool, transfer to a glass jar with a tight fitting lid and store at room temperature for up to a month. Strain the oil through a coffee filter and save it to use for stir-fried dishes or to make [Crispy Garlic (Ga-Tiem Chew)](/recipe/index.php?title=Crispy_Garlic_%28Ga-Tiem_Chew%29 "Crispy Garlic (Ga-Tiem Chew)")
