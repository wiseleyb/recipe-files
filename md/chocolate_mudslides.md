## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups unsweetened chocolate, in chips or chunks
- 8 cups bittersweet chocolate, in chips or chunks
- 3/8 cup unsalted butter
- 2 cups sugar
- 5 eggs
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 3/4 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 1/4 cup walnuts (optional).

## Directions

1. Preheat an oven to 400 degrees. Melt the unsweetened chocolate and 4 cups of the bittersweet chocolate over a double-boiler (a simple double boiler can be set up by putting a metal bowl over a simmering pot), stirring periodically.

2. Cream the butter and sugar in a mixer until light and fluffy and add the eggs one at a time, blending until mixed.

3. Add the flour, baking powder and salt to the butter mixture and mix just until combined.

4. Add the melted chocolate and mix until combined and stir in the nuts and remaining chocolate pieces. Pour the mixture onto a parchment-lined baking sheet or tray. Put the mixture into a refrigerator for 5 to10 minutes until slightly, but not completely, hardened.

5. Reverse the sheet or tray onto another piece of parchment paper on a hard surface. Use a knife to divide the mixture into 20 squares. With your hands, roll each of the squares into a ball and evenly space them on one or two parchment-lined baking sheets (leave room for them to spread).

6. Bake the cookies for 15 to 25 minutes, until crusty on the outside (they should still be gooey on the inside). Allow to cool for at least 20 minutes before eating.

Yield: 20 large cookies.
