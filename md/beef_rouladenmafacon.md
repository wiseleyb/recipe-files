## Credits

by Rainer Suletzki

## Ingredients

- 4 slices of thinly cut top round beef (see note)
- 1 large onion, diced 
- 8 slices of breakfast bacon 
- 4 tsp good mustard (French/German)
- 4 large mushrooms, diced (champignon) 
- seasoning to your taste 
- 5 oz red wine
- 4 tbs oil
- beef stock (to not quite cover rouladen)

## Directions

Note: Try to have the meat cut approx. 1/8 inch thick, otherwise meet has to   
be pounded to make it flexible enough to be handled.   
  
Season the meat slice (one side only) by spreading one teaspoon of mustard on it. Then place two slices of bacon on it. Add one tsp of diced onion and one tbs of diced mushroom to the wider end of the meat slice and start rolling.  
  
Halway through the roll try to fold in both meat sides to actually crate a pouch. Secure the roulade witha toothpick or twine.  
  
Heat your preferred oil in a heavy skillet and brown all rouladen evenly for   
several minutes, add red wine (appox. 4 - 5 ounces) and turn rouladen in   
liquid; add beef bouillion, not quite to cover rouladen and simmer for appoximately 1.5 hours or until very tender.   
  
Remaining liquid is an excellent base for the gravy.   
  
Note: Make 8 or more Rouladen at any one time, they can be deep frozen easily and you don't have to go through all this work each time you feel like rouladen.
