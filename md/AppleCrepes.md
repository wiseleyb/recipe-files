## Ingredients

- 1 stick butter 
- 1 cup brown sugar 
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon 
- 1/4 teaspoon fresh grated nutmeg 
- 1 cup walnut pieces 
- 3 Granny Smith apples, cored and sliced 1/4-inch thick 
- 1/4 to 1/2 cup Apple Jack Brandy, or any other apple liquor or brandy 
- 8 scoops Cinnamon ice cream 
- 8 crepes 
- 2 ounces crumbled Maytag Blue cheese

## Directions

In a saute pan, melt the butter. Stir in the brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Cook the mixture for 1 minute to dissolve the sugar. Add the walnuts and apples. Cook the apples for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the apples are tender and caramelized. Remove the pan from the heat and add the brandy. Place the pan back on the stove. Shake the pan a couple of times to ignite the flame. If the flame does not ignite, carefully light the flame with a match. Spread a scoop of the ice cream evenly over each crepe. Starting with one side, gently roll the crepe up like a jellyroll. Place the crepes in the freezer and freeze until firm, about 1 hour. Divide the crepes between four shallow bowls. Spoon the apple/walnut mixture over the crepes. Sprinkle the cheese over the top and serve immediately.
