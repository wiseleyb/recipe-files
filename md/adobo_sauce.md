[Carne Adobada: Grilled Adobo-Marinated Skirt Steak](https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/carne-adobada-grilled-adobo-marinated-skirt-steak-364409) by ROBERTO SANTIBAÃ‘EZ and JJ GOODE

## Ingredients

- 2 ounces pasilla chiles (6), wiped clean, stemmed, slit open, seeded, and deveined
- 2 ounces guajillo chiles (8), wiped clean, stemmed, slit open, seeded, and deveined
- 1/4 cup distilled white vinegar
- 1/4 cup light Mexican beer
- 1/2 cup chopped white onion
- 4 garlic cloves, peeled
- 1 teaspoon fine salt, or 2 teaspoons kosher salt
- 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano, preferably Mexican
- 1/4 teaspoon cumin seeds
- 5 whole cloves

## Directions

Heat a comal, griddle, or heavy skillet over medium-low heat, and toast the
chiles 2 or 3 at a time, turning them over and pressing down on them with tongs
frequently, until the chiles are fragrant, about 1 minute per batch. Soak the
chiles in enough cold water to cover until they're soft, about 30 minutes.
Drain and discard the soaking water.

Put the vinegar and beer in the blender jar with the chiles and the remaining
adobo ingredients. Blend until smooth, at least 3 minutes, adding a little
water if necessary to puree. If you like a silky, smooth texture, strain the
adobo through a medium-mesh sieve. Set aside 1/2 cup of the adobo to marinate
the steak, and keep the rest in an airtight container in the refrigerator for
up to five days or in the freezer for up to one month.

## Usage

Marinate steak for 3+ hours (up to 5 days). Use as finishing sauce.
