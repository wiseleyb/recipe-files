Squeeze bread almost dry; discard milk. Blend bread into meat mixutre. Shape mixture into 24 meatballs, using 1 rounded tablespoonful for each.  
  
Heat oil in heavy large skillet over medium heat. Add meatballs; saute until brown and cooked through, turning often to hold shape, about 15 minutes. Add meatballs and drippings in skillet to pot of Tomato-Sausage Sauce. Simmer to blend flavors, about 10 minutes.  
  
Place pasta in large bowl. Add 1.5 cups sauce and toss to coat. Top with meatballs and remaining sauce. Server with additional Parmesan cheese.

**Notes:** This recipe makes way too much food for 2 people - think about cutting it in half or by 2/3's for a couple.
