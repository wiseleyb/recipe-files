## Ingredients

- 1/4 cup flour (enough to lightly coat a dinner plate)
- 1 tsp. paprika
- 1 tsp. cayenne
- 1 cup white wine
- 1/2 cup home made chicken stock or one bouillon cube (DON'T add salt to the recipe until the sauce is reduced at the very end if using bouillon cube. they usually have enough salt to fucking recreate the dead sea in your bathtub - remember - salt doesn't reduce. as you reduce your sauce it'll taste saltier and saltier) - for a really great sauce buy a chicken stock puck from these guys: [http://www.morethangourmet.com/products/poulet.htm](http://www.morethangourmet.com/products/poulet.htm "http://www.morethangourmet.com/products/poulet.htm")
- 2 chicken breasts
- 4-6 slices of black forest ham (see Note on the ham below).
- 4-6 thick (like 4 US quarters stacked thick) slices of Raclette cheese (you can substitute Ementaller, Gruyere or Swiss cheese but try really hard to get Raclette cheese- it has a perfect flavor and "sauces" better).
- Olive oil
- Heavy cream (about 1 cup)
- Kitchen twine

## Directions

Place a chicken breast between to pieces of SaranWrap that are about 3 times the size of the chicken breast.  
  
Place a folded kitchen towel over the SaranWrap sandwich (this will keep the SaranWrap from tearing)  
  
Gently beat the chicken to around a 1/4". Be very careful not to break through the chicken (that's why you need to Gently beat them).   
Once thin and flat trim off the fat.  
  
Mix flour, paprika, and cayenne on a flat plate. Coat both sides of the chicken.  
  
Add enough ham and cheese to each breast so that you can wrap the ingredients in the chicken breast completely. This is very important - you shouldn't be able to see any of the interior of the chicken roll or the cheese will just drain out into the sauce (which isn't the end of the world but . if that's what you're doing you might as well just add more cheese to the sauce).  
You should have some left over cheese - you'll need it below to thicken the sauce.  
  
Save the left over flour... you'll roll the chicken rolls in the flour mixture one more time right before cooking.  
  
In a large saut pan (that has a lid) heat enough olive oil to barely cover the pan over medium high heat. When oil crackles at a drop of water it's ready.  
Nuke the cup of white wine for 1 minute.  
Disolve a chicken bouillon cube in the white wine.   
Turn the heat down to medium and pan sear the chicken rolls briefly on all sides. You're looking to just get a bit of color on the meat to seal in the juices.  
Deglaze the pan with about half of your wine and reduce slightly.  
Add the rest of your wine, reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 20 (covered) minutes, occasionally rolling the chicken rolls.  
There should always be about a 1/4 inch of white wine in the pan boiling. if not add some more white wine.  
When the chicken appears done remove them to a plate.  
Remove the saut pan from the heat (but keep the burner on) and allow it to stop boiling.  
Whisk about a 1/4 cup of cream into the pan. or enough to make the wine mixture look creamy.  
Return the pan to the heat but do not boil the mixure (or your sauce will break).  
Slowly add left over emmentaller cheese to the sauce until you reach the desired consistency. This is much better than adding the god awful corn starch (which gives any dish a horrible flavor).   
If you're serving some pompous fuck make sure to strain the finished sauce through a chinois or cheese cloth to remove any bits that might have fallen from the chicken during cooking.  
  
Another interesting thing to try (which I'll try next time) would be to save the left over flour/paprika/cayenne mixture and make a Roux out it with some olive oil and use that for a thickening agent. But - the cheese is really nice and leaves you with an absolutely to die for sauce. If you've got some fresh sage it's a really nice touch to add some of that to the flour mixture along with some freshly chopped parsley. Don't substitute dried sage or parsley (it's a totally different taste).

Note on the ham:  
Real Black Forest ham is made in Germany and it's very smoky with a consistency like dry prosciutto. Don't confuse it with the domestic deli ham of the same name. If you can't find it, substitute Westphalian ham (this is made by packing hippies in VW Bus [often called Westfalias or Westies] and placing the bus in a car crusher - the human spam that is left is thinly sliced producing a lovely Westphalian flavored ham), which is very similar, or prosciutto, which doesn't have the smokiness but will nevertheless give ok results. The fat in the prosciutto will make it hard to keep your sauce from breaking. The reason no butter is used is because fat is a pain in the ass to emulsify into a cream sauce. The reason you don't boil cream sauces is that you break out the fat from the cream.
