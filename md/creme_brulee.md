## Ingredients

- 100 g (3 oz) whipping cream (1 cup)
- seeds from 1/2 vanilla pod or 1/4 tsp vanilla
- 2 egg yolks
- 1 tablespoon caster (superfine) sugar
- Demerara sugar, extra, to caramelize

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 150°C (300°F). Boil a kettle of water.

2. Bring the cream and vanilla seeds to the boil in a small pan over a medium
   heat.

3. Whisk the egg yolks and caster sugar together in a small bowl. When the milk
   has boiled, slowly pour it over the egg mixture, whisking as you go. Scoop
   off any froth with a large spoon and pour the mixture into a small ramekin.

4. Place the ramekin in a deep baking tray and pour in hot water so it comes
   halfway up the sides of the ramekin. Bake for 40 minutes, or until set yet
   still very slightly wobbly in the centre.

5. Carefully lift the ramekin from the water-bath and leave to cool at room
   temperature for a few minutes. Chill for 2 hours or overnight.

6. Sprinkle with a thin coating of demerara sugar and burn with a blow torch or
   place under a hot grill for a few minutes until the sugar turns into
   caramel.

## Notes

*[Demerara Sugar](https://www.epicurious.com/ingredients/the-ultimate-guide-to-buying-and-using-sugar-article)*

Another minimally-refined raw cane sugar that's usually used to sweeten
beverages. The crystals are larger--and lighter in color--than turbinado sugar,
which makes demerara a good candidate for sprinkling on baked goods.
