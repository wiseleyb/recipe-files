## Ingredients

- 3.5 cups whole wheat flour 
- 4 oz. margarine 
- salt 
- water to mix 
- oil and margarine for cooking 
- 6 oz potatoes 
- 1 fresh hot green chili pepper 
- 3/4-inch piece fresh root ginger 
- 1/2 cup fresh coriander leaves 
- 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper

## Directions

To make the filling, boil the potatoes in their skins. Drain well, then peel and mash them.   

 Remove the seeds from the chile pepper and chop finely with the peeled ginger and the fresh coriander. Mix together with the potato and season with the cayenne pepper and salt to taste.   
  

 In a food processor, mix the flour, salt, and butter together and add a little water, about 1 tbl. , just enough to make a firm dough.Divide into 12 balls and put aside, covered with a damp cloth. On a lightly floured surface, roll out two of the balls to flat discs of about 4 inches in diameter.   
  

 Place a little of the filling on one disc and cover it with the second disc. Use the rolling pin to gently flatten the bread and seal the edges. The bread will now be about 7 inches in diameter. Heat the tawa, or griddle, brush with oil and cook the bread, turning it once.   
  

 Traditionally, the bread is only half cooked on the griddle. Then a little butter is melted in a non-stick pan and the paratha are shallow-fried to a crisp finish; however, the frying can be omitted and all the cooking done on the griddle. Continue to make the remaining breads in the same way, keeping them warm in the oven. When all are cooked, serve them hot. Makes 6.
