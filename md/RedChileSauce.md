## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons canola oil 
- 1 large red onion, coarsely chopped 
- 3 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped 
- 2 New Mexican red chiles, lightly toasted 
- 2 quajillo chiles, lightly toasted 
- 1 ancho chile, lightly toasted 
- 6 to 8 cups homemade chicken stock 
- 1/4 cup creme fraiche 
- 2 tablespoons maple syrup 
- Salt and freshly ground pepper

## Directions

Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onions and garlic, and cook until soft. Add the chiles and stock, and bring to a simmer for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the chiles are soft. Transfer the mixture to a food processor and process until smooth.   
  
 Strain the mixture into a saute pan that has been set on high heat for a few minutes, and cook the sauce until slightly thick. Remove from the heat and stir in the creme fraiche and maple syrup. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.
