# Beef Stew 

## Credits

by Greg Atkinson

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup olive oil
- 1/2 cup flour
- 2 lbs beef stew meat, cut into 1-inch cubes
- 1 small onion, peeled and finely chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, peeled
- pinch of dried thyme
- black pepper
- 1 can (22 ounces) tomatoes
- 1 can (17 ounces) beef broth
- 1 cup red wine or coffee
- 3 medium carrots, peeled and sliced 1/8 inch thick
- 4 large thin-skinned potatoes, such as White Rose or Yukon Gold, cut into 1/2 inch cubes
- 1 package (10 ounces) frozen peas
- salt to taste

## Directions

In a large stew pot with a heavy base, cook oil and flour over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, for 6 to 8 minutes, or until flour is nicely browned. (If left unstirred for even a moment, the flour may burn; if it does, discard the roux and begin again.) When you have a smooth, evenly browned base with no black specks, stir in beef. Add onion, garlic, thyme, pepper, tomatoes, beef broth, and wine or coffee. Brin the liquid to a boil, reduce heat to medium low, and cook 1 hour, stirring from time to time to prevent sticking.  
  
 Add carrots, potatoes, and peas and cook 30 minutes longer, or until potatoes are tender. Taste and add salt as desired.

Notes:  
 I often just use beef and 1 potatoe and leave out the carrots and peas.
