## Ingredients

- 4 tablespoons virgin olive oil
- 1 medium red onion, thinly sliced
- 6 mint leaves
- 1/2 tablespoon crushed red pepper
- 1 5-in. head of cauliflower, about 1 to 1.25 lbs.
- 1-lb. rigatoni pasta
- 1/2 cup grated pecorino cheese
- 2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper
- 1 bunch Italian parsley, finely chopped to yield 1/4 cup

## Directions

Bring 6 quarts water to boil in a large spaghetti pot and add 2 tablespoons
salt.

In a 14- to 18-in. sauté pan, heat oil until just smoking and add onion, mint
and red pepper. Cook until soft, about 5 to 6 minutes.

Meanwhile, remove leaves and base core from cauliflower and chop into ¼-in.
pieces. Break the florets away from the central core and size them similarly.
Cut the core into 1/4-in. coins and throw all the pieces into the sauté pan with
the onions. Lower the heat to medium and cook, stirring regularly for about 12
to 15 minutes, until cauliflower is softened and light brown but not mushy.

Cook the rigatoni according to package instructions until "al dente," about 8
to 12 minutes, and drain in colander. Toss hot pasta into pan with cauliflower
and add grated cheese, black pepper and parsley. Toss to coat and serve
immediately.
