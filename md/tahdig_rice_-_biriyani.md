## Ingredients

- 400g (2 1/4c) long grain basmati rice
- 1L/1000g water
- 10g (2t) coarse salt 
- 1g (1t) saffron
- Olive oil
- 75g (5T) butter 

## Directions

Rinse rice until water runs clear then cover it with about 1L/1000g water. To
that add 10g salt stir and allow to brine for 1 hour. Drain off salty water. 

Heat a heavy bottomed pot of water until it comes to a boil. 

Crush saffron into a powder with a mortar and pestle. Add in about 1/2c or 100g
of the boiling water into the mortar with the saffron powder to bloom it for
about 3 minutes. 

Salt water generously then add in brined rice and boil for 3 minutes. Drain off
the water and transfer rice to a bowl. Fold in saffron water. 

Heat a nonstick pan (with a lid) over medium heat. Add a generous amount of
olive oil, about 1-2T, and 75g of butter. Once melted, add in all of the
saffron rice, pressing down and spreading into an even layer. Dock the rice
with the end of a wooden spoon about 10 times. 

Wrap the lid of the pan with a kitchen towel then place towel-wrapped lid on
the pan. Lower the heat to low and cook for 25-30 minutes, rotating the pan
regularly for even browning. When done, the rice should smell toasty and you
should see some light browning around the edges. 

Flip onto a plate so that the brown bottom becomes the top.
