## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 3/4 cup water
- 1/2 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1/2 tablespoon dark sesame oil (from an Asian market)
- 1/2 tablespoon chopped fresh ginger root
- 1 clove garlic, chopped
- 1 tablespoon chili garlic sauce (such as Tuong Ot Toi Vietnam brand)
- 1 to 2 tablespoons peanut oil
- 5 cups assorted chopped or julienned vegetables (broccoli florets, onions, zucchini, snow peas, carrots, red and green bell peppers, Napa cabbage, bean sprouts)
- 1/4 pound fresh lo mein or soba noodles, cooked according to package directions and drained
- 1/2 tablespoon sesame seeds, toasted
- 3 scallions, finely chopped

## Directions

1. In a bowl stir together the cornstarch and 1/4 cup water.

2. In another bowl, combine the remaining 1/2 cup water, soy sauce, sesame oil, ginger, garlic, and chili sauce.

3. In a wok or large skillet, add enough peanut oil to the pan to barely coat the bottom.

4. Add the vegetables. Cook, stirring, until broccoli turns emerald. Remove from the pan; keep warm.

5. Pour the soy sauce mixture into the skillet and bring to a boil. Mix the cornstarch and water again. Stir half of it into the pan. If you want a thicker sauce, add the remaining cornstarch.

6. Return the vegetables to the pan. Toss over high heat. Add the noodles and toss again.

7. Sprinkle with sesame seeds and scallions.
