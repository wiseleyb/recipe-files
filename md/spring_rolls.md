## Ingredients

Spring Rolls

- Salt 
- 1lb/.5kg large shell on raw shrimp (iâ€™m using 12/15 eazy peel shrimp) 
- 110g/4oz rice vermicelli 
- 180g/1 large carrot, shredded (I use my julienne peeler for this) 
- 20g or 2Tbsp sugar 
- 20g or 1 1/2Tbsp rice vinegar 
- 1/4 head purple cabbage, thinly shredded (i slice thinly on a mandoline) 
- 1 extra large red bell pepper, julienned 
- 4 mini cucumbers, julienned 
- Fresh herbs: basil, mint, cilantro 
- 12 pieces of spring roll rice paper (2 per roll) 
- Green leaf lettuce 

Sauce

- 100g or 1/3c hoisin 
- 30g 2Tbsp peanut butter 
- 3-5g/1 small clove grated garlic 
- 3-5g about 1/2Tbsp grated ginger 
- 30g or 2Tbsp rice vinegar 
- 5g or 1tsp sesame oil 
- 30g or 2Tbsp water 

## Directions

Whisk sauce to combine

Bring two pots of water to a boil. Add a LOT of salt to one of the pots. The
water should taste salty like the sea. Add shrimp to the salty water then
immediately remove the pot from heat and allow the shrimp to poach for 4
minutes (off heat). 

After the 4 minute poach, transfer the shrimp to a paper towel lined plate/tray
to drain then move to the fridge to cool. 

In the second boiling pot of water, turn off heat then add about half as much
salt as you did for the shrimp pot, then add the rice vermicelli. Allow
vermicelli to soften in the hot water for 4 minutes, drain and rinse with cold
water. 

Cut vermicelli a few times to prevent clumping then transfer to paper towel to
dry a bit. 

To quick pickle the carrots, add shredded carrots to a bowl along with 10g
salt, 20g sugar, and 20g rice vinegar. Toss to coat, then allow to marinate for
5-10min. 

Soak 1 sheet of rice paper in room temp water for 5 seconds. Place on plate and
build by layering 2 shrimp (sliced horizontally), a few pieces of cucumber &
bell pepper, a pinch of cabbage, pinch of carrots, pinch of soaked noodles,
herbs, & a piece or two of lettuce. 

Wrap the roll as shown in the video @5:14. Finish by rolling in a second skin
of rice paper that has been soaked for 10 secs.
