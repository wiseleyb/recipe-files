## Ingredients

- Apple Chutney: 
- 2 tablespoons canola oil 
- 1 small red onion, finely chopped 
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh ginger 
- 2 cloves garlic, chopped 
- 1/2 jalapeno chile, finely diced 
- 3 Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored and diced 
- 1/2 cup apple juice 
- 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar 
- 1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh thyme leaves 
- Salt and freshly ground pepper

## Directions

Heat oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion, ginger, garlic, and jalapeno, and cook until soft. Add half of the apples, the apple juice and vinegar, and cook until the apples are soft. Remove from the heat and stir in the remaining apples and the thyme. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Transfer to a bowl and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before serving so that flavors meld.
