## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup softened butter
- 1 1/2 cups sugar
- 2 eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 cups flour
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 cup milk
- 2 cups blueberries, washed, drained and picked over
- 3 teaspoons sugar

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 375.

2. Cream the butter and 1 1/4 cups sugar until light.

3. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add vanilla.

4. Sift together the flour, salt and baking powder, and add to the creamed
   mixture alternately with the milk.

5. Crush 1/2 cup blueberries with a fork, and mix into the batter. Fold in the
   remaining whole berries.

6. Line a 12 cup standard muffin tin with cupcake liners, and fill with batter.
   Sprinkle the 3 teaspoons sugar over the tops of the muffins, and bake at 375
   degrees for about 30-35 minutes.

7. Remove muffins from tin and cool at least 30 minutes. Store, uncovered, or
   the muffins will be too moist the second day, if they last that long.

## Notes

* coat blueberries in flour before adding (keeps them from sinking to the bottom)
* cut sugar by at least 1/4 cup
* add 1 tsp cinammon
* use buttermilk instead of milk
* dust top with sugar before baking
* add 1 tsp lemon zest

## Variations

* substitute 1 diced apple and cinammon for blueberries
