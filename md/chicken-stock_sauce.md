# Chicken Stock Sauce

## Credits

Ben

## Ingredients

- chicken back from spatchcocked chicken (I do brick chicken on the grill)
- 1/2 onion
- 1 carrot
- 1 stalk celery
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 cup white wine
- 1 cup water
- pepper corns
- corn starch
- optional extras if you have it: parsley stems, few sprigs of thyme

## Directions

I use this for a basic gravy for chicken dishes and for Potatoes Fondant (so
good). When you spatchcock chicken (remove backbone, for doing Brick Chicken)
you're left with a backbone... so this is how you turn that into gold.

Cut chicken back into 1 inch pieces or so

Brown chicken back in some oil in a pan (don't use non-stick - you want fond,
use stainless steel pan)

Add onion, carrot - brown a bit more

Add garlic - saute til fragrant

Add in wine to deglaze (scrape up the fond/brown-bits)

Add water

Add celery and extras

Simmer for 30 minutes or so

Strain

Reduce, season, maybe thicken with corn starch slurry
