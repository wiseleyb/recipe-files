## Ingredients

- 2 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for the pans
- 3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for the pans
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 1/4 cups sugar
- 4 large eggs, at room temperature
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- 1 1/4 cups whole milk (or 3/4 cup heavy cream mixed with 1/2 cup water)

### 1/2 recipe

- 1 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for the pans
- 1.5 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for the pans
- 1/2 tablespoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup + 1/8 cup sugar 
- 2 large eggs, at room temperature
- 1/2 tablespoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup + 1/8 cup whole milk (or 3/4 cup heavy cream mixed with 1/2 cup water)
## Directions

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter two 9-inch-round cake pans and line
the bottoms with parchment paper; butter the parchment and dust the pans with
flour, tapping out the excess.

Whisk 3 cups flour, the baking powder and salt in a bowl until combined. Beat 2
sticks butter and the sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed
until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to medium; beat
in the eggs, one at a time, scraping down the bowl as needed. Beat in the
vanilla. (The mixture may look separated at this point.) Beat in the flour
mixture in 3 batches, alternating with the milk, beginning and ending with
flour, until just smooth.

Divide the batter between the prepared pans. Bake until the cakes are lightly
golden on top and a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean, 30 to
35 minutes. Transfer to racks and let cool 10 minutes, then run a knife around
the edge of the pans and turn the cakes out onto the racks to cool completely.
Remove the parchment. Trim the tops of the cakes with a long serrated knife to
make them level, if desired.
