Peel poblanos, then halve lenthwise, discarding stems and seeds. Coarsley chop.  
  
 Cook onion in butter in a 12 inch heavy skillet over moderate heat, stiring, until softened, 7 to 8 minutes. Add broth and bring to a boil.  
  
 Puree onion mixture with cream cheese and poblanos in a blender until smoooth (use caution when blending hot liquids). Boil puree in skillet, stirring until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir in crumbled bouillon cube and season with salt. Transfer sauce to a serving bowl and keep warm, covered.  
  
 Cook steaks:  
 Pat steaks dry adn season well with salt and pepper. Heat oil in cleaned 12 inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sear steaks 5 minutes on each side. Remove skillet from heat, then add tequila and ignite it carefully, shaking skillet until flames die down. Return to moderately high heat and simmer steaks, uncovered, turning once, 2 - 4 minutes for medium-rare. Transfer steaks to plate. Boil tequila, scraping up brown bits, 1 minute, then stir into poblano sauce.
