# Pasta with Simple White sauce 

## Credits

by Ben

## Ingredients

- Spaghetti (two servings - about half a box)
- 1 egg 
- kosher salt
- 1/2 (or more) cup parmesan
- 1/2 stick butter
- ground pepper
- oven proof mixing bowl (metal, ceramic)

## Directions

Preheat oven to 250  
 Place bowl in oven with butter (so it melts)  
 Preheat pasta bowls as well  
  
 Boil pasta in heavily salted water (salting water very important - as the pasta flavor is a major component)  
  
 Beat the egg in a bowl while pasta is boiling  
  
 Right before pasta is done cooking reserve 1 cup of it's boiling water (pasta water will have taste and the starch in it is used a thickening agent)  
  
 Drain pasta and immediately move it to the bowl that's been in the oven with th butter.   
  
 Quickly toss and slowly add parmesan cheese and beaten egg.  
  
 If it's too dry add a bit of the pasta water.  
  
 Season with more parm and black pepper. Serve in preheated bowls.  
  
 If you're really lazy about dishes you could use the pot that you boiled the pasta in for mixing and melt the butter in the microwave.
