## Ingredients

- 8 large Yukon gold potatoes, washed, peeled and quartered
- Salt
- Canola oil, to cook
- 2 tablespoons minced garlic
- 1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme
- 1 1/2 cups heavy cream
- 3 ounces of butter
- 3 eggs
- 1/2 cup sifted flour
- 3 pound piece center cut beef tenderloin, cleaned and trimmed, cut into 2 pieces
- Salt and black pepper, to taste
- 1 cup flour, to coat
- 4 eggs, to coat
- 1 cup Panko bread crumbs, to coat

## Directions

(One can and should use leftover mashed potatoes, but still add the eggs and flour. That was how we invented this dish). Preheat a fryer to 350 degrees. In a saucepan, add potatoes and fill with cold water. Add a little salt. Slowly boil potatoes for 30 to 40 minutes until potatoes come cleanly off of a paring knife. In another hot saucepan coated with oil, caramelize garlic than add thyme and cream. Reduce cream by 30 percent. In a mixing bowl with paddle attachment, add hot potatoes and garlic cream. Mix together until smooth. Add butter, salt and pepper and check for seasoning. Let cool. Whisk together the eggs and flour until smooth. Mix with the cool mash. Season both pieces of beef well with salt and pepper. Coat with 1/2-inch of potato puree. Dredge the coated beef in flour, then eggs, then panko. Deep fry until golden brown, about 5 to 8 minutes, the beef will be rare to medium-rare. Let rest for 5 minutes before slicing.
