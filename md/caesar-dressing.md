## Credits

## Ingredients

- 1-2 cloves garlic
- 2 anchovy filets
- 1 egg yolk
- 1/2 tsp dijon mustard
- juice from 1/2 small lemon
- 1/8 cup olive oil
- salt and pepper
- dash of Worcestershire
- optional hot-sauce

## Directions

1. In a mortar and pestle (M&P) add a pinch of kosher salt and garlic.... grind
   to smooth paste

2. Add anchovies... grind to smooth paste again

3. Whisk egg-yolk and mustard in separate bowl ... then add to M&P

4. Whisk M&P contents until combined, add lemon juice, rewhisk

5. Slowly whisk in oil until you have a mayonnaise 

6. Season with S&P, hot sauce

7. Thicken with shaved parm if needed (or add parm when making salad)

Note: For salad... I only use romaine hearts, you can buy "mini-romaine" these
days in stores which are perfect for this. I like to wash/dry/put-in-the-fridge
the leaves (they need to be dry for the dressing to stick). And use a peeler
for the parm to get long slices of parm (but also used some shaved when mixing
with dressing). I don't really like garlic-croutons on salads but, if you do,
tons of recipes out there and super classic. Some of the better salads I've had
did croutons with long, off-bias cuts of french bread - so a croustini instead
of a garlic crouton. Great for presentation.

Note: If you want a grilled chicken caesar... just pound a chicken breast until
about 1/8" thick. S&P and brush on some caesar dressing, if you have some carne
asada spice blend - add it, then grill.

Note: Storing anchovies... if using tinned anchovies transfer to small jar -
completely submerge in oil. Store in fridge. If using jarred anchovies, make
sure they're covered in oil, store in fridge. Before re-using pull from fridge
for around an hour to allow to come to room temp... oil tends to congeal in the
fridge.
