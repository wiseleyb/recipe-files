## Directions

1. Combine the tangerine juice, mirin, soy sauce, sugars, ginger, garlic, and zest in a small saucepan over medium heat. Simmer and reduce byhalf, about 19 minutes. Make a slurry by mixing the corn starch with the water. Add the slurry to the simmering glaze and allow to simmer another minute. The galze should be as thick as maple syrup. Reserve one quarter of the galze in a sparate small bowl.  
  
 Fire up the grill or preheat the broiler. Cut each chicken breast into 4 pieces, about 2 inches by 1 inch each. Thread 1 piece of chicken on each skewer, brush with oil, and season with salt and pepper. Grill or broil the chicken skewers over meium coals, turning often, and brushing 2 or 3 times with the glaze. Watch carefully because the sugars in the glaze can burn; reduce the heat or adjust the grill as necessary. When the chicken is cooked through, after about 7 minutes, remove the skewers from the grill, adn sppon the reserved glaze over the chicken just before serving.
