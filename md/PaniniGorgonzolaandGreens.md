## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup each: escarole, endive and radicchio leaves, thinly sliced
- 1 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 2 teaspoons imported red wine vinegar
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 4 slices crusty country bread, white or mild whole wheat
- 2 ounces Gorgonzola, softened at room temperature

## Directions

1. Place the greens in a small bowl and dress with oil, vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste. (Remember Gorgonzola is salty so go easy on the salt.) Toss well.

    2. Spread 2 slices of bread with Gorgonzola. Top with greens and drizzle with any dressing left in the bowl. Cover with the remaining bread and press down lightly.
