## Ingredients

- 3/4 [Dry Rub for Barbecue](/recipe/index.php?title=Dry_Rub_for_Barbecue "Dry Rub for Barbecue")
- 1 whole beef brisket (9 to 11 pounds), fat trimmed to 1/4 inch thickness
- 2 cups wood chips
- 2 cups [Classic Barbecue Sauce](/recipe/index.php?title=Classic_Barbecue_Sauce "Classic Barbecue Sauce")

## Directions

I have no grilling skills and simply followed this recipe. The brisket came out amazing. This goes great with [Boston Baked Beans](/recipe/index.php?title=Boston_Baked_Beans "Boston Baked Beans") and [Cole Slaw](/recipe/index.php?title=Cole_Slaw "Cole Slaw").

1. Apply the rub liberally to all sides of the meat, pressing down to make sure the spice adhere and completely obscure the meat. Wrap the brisket tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2 hours. (For stonger flavor, refrigerate for up to 2 days.)  
  
2. About hour prior to cooking, remove the brisket from the refrigerator, unwrap, and let come to room temperature.  
  
3. Soak the wood chips for 15 minutes in a bowl of water to cover. Place the wood chips in a foild tray. Place the foil tray with the soaked wood ships on top of primary burner. Turn all burners to high and preheat with lid down until chips are smoking heavily, about 20 minutes.  
  
4. Scrape the grate clean with a wire brush. Turn the primary burner down to medium and turn off the other burner(s). Position the brisket, fat side up, over the cool part of the grill. Cover and barbecue for 2 hours. (The temperature inside the grill should be a constant 275 degrees; adjust the lit burner as necessary).  
  
5. Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and preheat the oven to 300 degrees. Attach two 48-inch pieces of heavy-duy foil by folding the long edges together two or three times, crimping tightly to seal well, to form a rectangle of about 36 by 48 inches. Position the brisket lengthwise in the center of the foil. Bring the short edges over the brisket and fold down, crimping tightly to seal. Repeat with the long sides of the foil to seal the brisket completely. Place the brisket on a jelly roll pan. Bake until the meat is fork-tender, 3 to 3.5 hours.  
  
6. Remove the brisket from the over, loosen the foil at one end to release steam, and let rest for 30 minutes. If you like, drain the juices into a bowl and defat the juices in a gravy skimmer.  
  
7. Unwrap the brisket and place it on a cutting board. Separate the meat into two sections and carve it against the grain on the diagonal into long, thing slices. Serve with plain barbecue sauce or with barbecue sauce that has been flavored with up to 1 cup of defatted brisket juices.

**Notes**  
I've done this recipe once and made these modifications:  
1. Marinated for about 20 hours  
2. Wasn't quite room temp when started grilling.  
3. Soaked the wood chips for 2 hours and preheated grill to 275. I started BBQing before the chips were smoking.  
4. The two large pieces (8 lbs) of brisket I had didn't have a "fat side". I flipped them twice. I BBQ'd the briskets for about 2.5 hours.  
5. I kept brisket in the oven for around 4 hours.  
6. I forgot to relieve the steam.  
  
Outcome: best brisket I've ever had.
