## Ingredients

Lemonade

- 3 c. water, divided 
- 3/4 c. granulated sugar 
- Juice of 6 large lemons (about 3/4 cup)

Iced Tea

- 4 c. water 
- 1/3 c. honey 
- 5 black tea bags 

## Directions

1. Make lemonade: In a small pot over medium heat, bring 1 cup water and sugar
   to a boil, stirring to dissolve sugar. Let boil 2 minutes. Let cool to room
   temperature.
2. Combine simple syrup, remaining 2 cups water, and lemon juice. 
3. Make tea: In a medium pot over medium-high heat, bring water to a boil. Add
   honey and stir to dissolve. Turn off heat and add tea bags. Let steep 5
   minutes. Let cool to room temperature. 
4. In a large pitcher, combine lemonade and tea. Pour into glasses over ice and
   garnish with mint and lemon wedges.

## Adjustments

I make 1 batch Lemonade and 2 batches Iced Tea and then add 4+ more cups of
water (I like this weaker than this recipe makes). You can also cut down on
sugar in both to taste
