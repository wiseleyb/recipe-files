# Teriyaki Beurre Blanc 

<!-- BEGIN content -->

## Ingredients

- Teriyaki Glaze:
- 6 tablespoons soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons white sugar
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon fresh ginger, minced
- 6 tablespoons Japanese vinegar
- 3 tablespoons sake or sherry
- 1 teaspoon arrowroot 
- 1 tablespoon water
- Beurre Blanc:
- 1 cup white wine
- 1 tablespoon shallots, chopped
- 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
- 1 cup cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
- Salt, to taste

## Directions

Teriyaki Glaze: Combine the soy sauce, brown and white sugars, garlic, ginger, Japanese vinegar, and sake, and in a heavy-bottomed saucepot. Bring to a boil (the sauce will flame as the alcohol burns off). Dissolve the arrowroot in the water. Reduce the sauce to a hard simmer and add the arrowroot mixture. Simmer hard for 5 minutes more.  
  
 Beurre Blanc: Combine the wine, shallots, and vinegar in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Continue boiling until 1 tablespoon of liquid remains. Lower the heat and whisk in the butter, piece by piece. When the butter is completely incorporated, remove from heat and salt to taste.   
  
  
 Add the scallions, teriyaki glaze, and buerre blanc to the pan and heat until combined and slightly thickened, about 3 minutes.   
  
 Add mushrooms (especially Shitake) for more flavor or a more classic looking brown mushroom sauce.   
  
 This sauce goes well with Tuna and Steak.
