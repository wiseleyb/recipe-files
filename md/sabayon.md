## Ingredients

- 3 egg yolks
- 2.25 oz sugar
- 1.5 oz white wine (marsala)
- 3 oz whipping cream
- 1/4 tsp gelatin (bloomed in very little water) (optional)

## Directions

1. Whip cream  
 2. Combing yolks, wine, gelatin and sugar  
 3. Whisk over double boiler until thick  
 4. Put bowl in ice bath and cool down mixture (will thicken slightly)  
 5. When cool fold in whipped cream

Gelatin is optional. Definitely don't use more than 1/4 tsp, maybe use less - still experimenting. Traditionally Sabayon is served over berrys as a sauce in a wine glass... don't use Gelatin is you want it saucy. If you're using it as a dip (for strawberries) then Gelatin holds it together better. It also keeps the sauce from breaking.
