- 1/2 cup mint leaves

- 1 pound fettucine

## Directions

Bring 6 quarts water to boil and add 2 tablespoons salt.   
 Crack lobster shells and remove meat. Cut tail into 1/2-inch slices and claws into 3 pieces. Set aside tomalley.   
  
 In a blender, mix mint, basil, parsley, garlic, capers, tomatoes, black and chili pepper and extra-virgin olive oil to form smooth paste. If needed, add a little more olive oil. Pour pesto into large serving bowl.   
  
 Cook fettuccine according to package instructions until al dente. Add lobster into the pasta cooking water for 1 minute. Drain well. Pour hot pasta and lobster into the bowl and toss like a salad until well mixed and serve immediately. Sprinkle with chopped parsley leaves.

We found adding some lemon juice and a bit of salt made this recipe much better.
