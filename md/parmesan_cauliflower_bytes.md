## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 c. panko bread crumbs (or regular bread crumbs)
- 1/2 c. finely grated Parmesan
- 1/2 tsp. dried Italian seasoning
- Kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 1 head cauliflower, cut into florets
- 3 large eggs, lightly whisked
- Marinara, for serving

## Directions

Step 1

Preheat oven to 400Â°. Add panko, Parmesan, and Italian seasoning to a large
bowl. Season with salt and pepper, then mix everything together until
thoroughly combined.

Step 2

Dip cauliflower pieces in egg and then roll in bread crumb mixture until fully
coated and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. You may need to
press on the coating to help it stick to the cauliflower bites. Repeat until
all cauliflower florets are coated.

Step 3

Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until coating is golden brown and crunchy. Serve
with marinara.
