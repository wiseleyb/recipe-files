## Directions

Hi:  
With the Fast Growing Hispanic Markets that are increasing in Size across  
Many Geographical segments in the US of A. Here is a Good Choice for those  
of you who have some goats around the back yard or back forty, that are  
milking them and others that have more milk than what they know what to  
do with. Cajeta is the 'Taste' of Mexico, where in other parts of Latin/  
South American Countries it is also known as Dulce de Leche. Well, it kind  
of reminds me of My Moms Homemade Butterscrotch Pie, which is a Thanksgiving  
tradition in the home of the Dumb Dutchman. The Cajeta de Celaya is a small  
but busy town where the making of Cajeta has already become quite a Big  
Industry. Ya' can even buy it in different flavors, with liquor, wine,  
caramel, fruits, etc. The demand is growing so Fast on a Global Basis  
that the demand is becoming so great that poor-quality Cajetas are selling  
at a brisk pace.  
  
Goat/Sheep Milk, Cheeses, etc. have also become a Trend across America(s).  
However, many Modern SuzyHomakers have not been Introduced to this treat,  
as a dessert, sauce, topping, or even a late night trip to the refrigerator  
for a spoonful when you are having a sweet tooth. Caution though, because  
it is quite habit forming.  
  
This is one sure fire recipe that you can try..It comes from one of the

Grill-Meister.  
  
  
Cajeta: Goat's Milk Caramel Sauce  
Ingredients:  
2 Quarts of Goat's Milk, or a combination of Goat's Milk and Cow's  
Milk (Use whole milk in all cases)  
2 Cups of Sugar  
1 2-inch piece of cinnamon stick, preferably Mexican Canela  
1/2 teaspoon baking soda, dissolved in 1 Tablespoon of water  
  
Directions:  
In a medium-large Dutch Pot or Mexican Copper cazo, (6-quart for a single  
size batch).  
Combine the milk, sugar,and sinnamon stick and set voer medium-heat.  
Stir regularly until the milk come to a simmer (all the sugar should be  
dissolved at this point).  
Remove the Dutch pot from the heat and stir in the dissolved baking soda.

- 
  - Caution\*\* it will foam up if the goat's milk is acidic.\*\*  

When the bubbles subside return the pot to the heat.  
  
Adjust the heat to maintain the mixtur at a brisk simmer.  
(To high, and the mixture will boil over, too low and the cooking time  
will seem like an eternity).  
Coo, stirring regularly, until the mixture turns a pale golden color.  
(More or less than 1-hour)  
  
Now,  
Begin stirring frequently as the misture colors to a carame-brown and  
thickens to the consistency of Maple Syrup.  
(you will notice the bubbles becoming larger and glassier)  
Stir regularly so nothing sticks to the bottom of the Pot.  
Test a couple of drops on a cold plate.  
When cool, the cajeta should be the consistency of a medium-thick caramel  
sauce.  
If the cooled cjajeta is thicker (almost like caramel candy), stir in  
a Tablespoon or so of water and remove from the heat.  
If too runny...keep cooking and stirring.  
  
Pour the cajeta through a fine-mesh strainer set over a bowl or Wide Mouth  
Storage jar.  
  
When cool, cover and refrigerate until you are ready to serve.  
Warming before serving (a micro-wave works great here) makes it taste  
even Better.  
  
Cajeta keeps for a month or more in the refrigerator. Keep it covered  
tightly, to keep it from absorbing other flavors.
