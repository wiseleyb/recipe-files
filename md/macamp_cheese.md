**Notes** :  
 While the listed recipe is OK Kat and I like to Germanize this dish a bit. Do this instead for a much better dish:  
 1) Use really sharp cheddar and some kind of Ementaller cheese (about 75% cheddar to 25% ementaller).   
 2) Add about a 1/4 cup of white wine to the cheese sauce and eliminate the milk.  
 3) Melt butter and some fresh herbs (like oregano) and mix in with the bread crumbs  
 4) Use some artisan bread for the bread crumbs and rip them up by hand so you have a very coarse crumb.  
 5) Sprinkle top of dish with parmesan cheese.  
 6) Carmelize one large onion until it's a deep brown (this should take about 30 minutes... and is done by sauting the onions in olive oil over medium heat) and add it to the mac and cheese mixtures.  
 7) Get some thick cut black forest ham and add it to the mac & cheese.  
  
 The cheese sauce will seem grity but it all comes together in the oven.  
  
 This dish is just as good (if not better) nuked the next day (as surprising at that might seem).
