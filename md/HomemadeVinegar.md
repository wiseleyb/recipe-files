Making Your Own Vinegar  
  
A Brief History:  
The translation of the French word "vinaigre" means sour wine. The discovery that a cask of wine was past its time and had turned into a wonderful new product was certainly a benefit to the world, culinary and otherwise.   
  
Many ancient civilizations discovered the remarkable usefulness of vinegar. The Babylonians used it as a preservative and as a condiment, and it was they who began flavoring it with herbs. Roman legionnaires used it as a beverage. Biblical references show how it was often used for its soothing and healing properties and Hippocrates extolled its medicinal qualities. Even Hannibal had a use for this concoction - when he crossed the Alps, obstructive boulders were heated and doused with vinegar, which cracked and crumbled them. As recently as World War I, vinegar was being used to treat wounds. And today it is recommended for treatment of rashes, bites and other minor ailments when camping.   
  
Through the centuries, vinegar has been produced from many materials including molasses, sorghum, fruits, berries, melons, coconut, honey, beer, maple syrup, potatoes, beets, malt, grains and whey. But the principle remains unchanged - a fermentation of natural sugars to alcohol and then secondary fermentation to vinegar.

    

Making Your Own Vinegar:  
  
Why bother making vinegar at home? The main benefit is vinegar that is stronger and more flavorful than most vinegar you can buy. It's also a great use for leftover wine and it is very easy to do.   
  
All you need to make vinegar are a container, some wine (or beer), and a starter. The container can be a plain glass jug, a ceramic crock, or a small oak barrel. Barrels lend a softer, more interesting flavor to vinegar, but they are also far more expensive ($70 or more) than an empty gallon jar.   
  
Wine itself is easy enough to come by - just add your leftovers to the barrel or jug. Red wine, which usually has fewer sulfites than white, is more easily cultured; if you'd like to use white wine, start with a mixture of wine and water, in a ratio of about two to one.   
  
Until fairly recently, if you left wine to stand, the ubiquitous airborne bacterial called acetobacter turned it to vinegar. Today, winemakers commonly use sulfites or other preservatives to inhibit bacterial growth. As a result, an active bacterial culture must be added to wine in order to make vinegar.   
  
This is the trickiest part - finding a good starter. If you have a friend who's already making vinegar, just get a piece of his or her "mother," the large, slimy substance that forms on top of developing vinegar. Otherwise, buy an 8- or 12-ounce bottle of unpasteurized vinegar, also sold as "starter" from suppliers. This is enough to start a batch of vinegar, and you'll never have to buy it again.

    

The Process:  
  
First, fill your container about half full of wine. Let it stand uncovered overnight to aerate; the bacteria need plenty of oxygen. The following day, add the starter and cover the hole in the jug or barrel with cheesecloth or with a piece of coarsely woven cotton cloth that will let in oxygen but keep out insects and debris. Finally, set the container in a dark location with a fairly constant temperature. You may add leftover wine from time to time, but never fill the container more than two-thirds full.   
  
After a while - as little as two weeks in hot weather, and as long as two months at normal to cool room temperatures - a mold-like film will form on the surface of the liquid. This is the beginning of the mother. Within a few more weeks it will thicken, and you may remove it and use it to start your next batch of vinegar. You may choose not to remove it, but you should still take out a good portion from time to time, or it will continue to grow and take over you whole container.   
  
Whether you remove the mother or not, the bacteria will remain active, and eventually the liquid will begin to smell more like vinegar than wine. At this point - usually within two weeks after the mother develops - you can bottle the vinegar. Fill the bottles as full as possible, since you now want to exclude oxygen, and tightly cork them. Don't use metal caps, as vinegar will erode them. Lay down the bottles to age for a few months; this will mellow the sharpness and allow the flavors to become more complex.   
  
You don't have to bottle all the vinegar at once. Simply draw off enough for a bottle every now and then, and continue to replenish the vinegar in the barrel, keeping the container about two-thirds full. In fact, you don't have to bottle and age the vinegar at all - it can be used straight from the bottle, as long as you don't mind a fairly rustic brew.

    

Potential Problems and Solutions:  
  
If, after following the general directions above, you have one or more of the following problems, try the following solutions:   
  
Nothing happened:  
  
The wine you used may have been heavily treated with sulfites, which act as stabilizing and preserving agents; try diluting it with about one-third water. Alternatively, you might try a different wine, preferably red, from one of the several organic wineries of France or California; these wines contain no sulfites.   
  
Nothing happened (again):  
  
Your unpasteurized vinegar may not have contained viable bacteria.   
  
The vinegar doesn't smell good:  
  
Your bacteria may not have had enough oxygen. Try pouring the vinegar back and forth from one container to another several times, then wait a couple of days. Also, make sure you cover containers only with cheesecloth or cotton, and that the openings are fairly large.   
  
Your once-potent vinegar has weakened:   
  
After a while, bacteria convert acetic acid to carbon dioxide and water; you must draw off vinegar from time to time and add new wine, so the vinegar has alcohol on which to work.
