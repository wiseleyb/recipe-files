## Ingredients

- 2.5 to 3 pounds fish bones
- 2 tbs unsalted butter
- 1 large leek, washed well and chopped small
- 1 medium onion, chopped small
- 3 stalks celery, chopped small
- 2 carrots, peeled and sliced thin
- 3 bay leaves
- 2 sprigs fresh thyme
- 4 or 5 parsley stems
- 1/2 tsp whole black peppercorns
- 1 cup dry white wine
- salt (optional)

## Directions

(Jasper White): Although there are other, easier ways to make fish stock, this method extracts the maximum flavor from the fish bones. It is the only method for fish stock you need to know. The best bones for fish stock are from halibut, sole, flounder or lean white fish. Oilier fish like cod, pollock, bluefish, salmon and swordfish make inferior fish stock. As fish stock cooks for a much shorter time than the other types of stock, chop the vegetables smaller than usual, no larger than one inch.

1. Cut the bones into pieces 2 to 3 inches across. Trim the bones of any excess skin or viscera that may still be attached. Rinse or soak if necessary in cold water o completely remove any traces of blood.  
  
 2. Melt the butter in a stockpot on low heat and add the leek, onion, celery, carrots, bay leaves, thyme, parsley stems and peppercorns. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring a few times.  
  
 3. Add the wine and place the fish bones on top of the vegetables. Cover the pot and allow the bones to sweat in the aromatic steam. After 20 minutes, remove the lid and pour in 4 cups water, enough to cover the fish bones.  
  
 4. Raise the heat and bring the stock to a boil. Skim the top, then reduce to a slow simmer. Simmer for 10 minutes and remove from the heat. Allow the stock to sit for another 10 minutes. If you like, you can lightly salt the stock.  
  
 5. Gently strain the stock through a fine stainer and chill as quickly as possible.
