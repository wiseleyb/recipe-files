## Ingredients

- 1 head garlic
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2/3 cup water
- 1 cup pineapple juice
- 1/4 cup Kikkoman teriyaki sauce
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 1/3 cups dark brown sugar
- 3 tablespoons lemon juice
- 3 tablespoons minced white onion
- 1 tablespoon Jack Daniels Whiskey
- 1 tablespoon crushed pineapple
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

## Directions

325 Baking Pan  
1. Cut about 1/2-inch off of top of garlic. Cut the roots so that the garlic  
will sit flat. Remove the papery skin from the garlic, but leave enough so  
that the cloves stay together. Put garlic into a small casserole dish or  
baking pan, drizzle olive oil over it, and cover with a lid or foil. Bake in  
a preheated 325 oven for 1 hour. Remove garlic and let it cool until you  
can handle it.

    

2. Combine water, pineapple juice, teriyaki sauce, soy sauce, and brown  
sugar in a medium saucepan over medium/high heat. Stir occasionally until  
mixture boils then reduce heat until mixture is just simmering.

    

3. Add remaining ingredients to pan and stir. Squeeze the sides of the head  
of garlic until the pasty roasted garlic is squeezed out. Measure 2  
teaspoons into the saucepan and whisk to combine.

    

4. Let mixture simmer for 35-45 minutes or until sauce has reduced by about  
1/2 and is thick and syrupy. Make sure it doesn't boil over.

    

Makes 1 cup of glaze.
