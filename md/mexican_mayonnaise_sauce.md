## Ingredients

**Mayonnaise**

- 1 room temp egg
- 1/2 lemon juiced
- 1 garlic clove
- 1 tsp dijon mustard
- 1 cup light oil (vegetable oil, not olive-oil - see note)

**Flavoring**

- 1 lime juiced and zest
- 1 chilpotle pepper (from a can like Embasa) + sauce
- Paprika
- Chili Powder
- Salt
- Hot sauce (tabasco, habanero, Tapatio, etc)

## Directions

**Mayonnaise**

In a food processor add everything except the oil. Turn on food processor and slowly drizzle in oil... very slowly at first then faster if you want. Until desired thickness. Note that depending on your eggs they will be able to bind to more or less oil - so, keep an eye on things... you don't need to use all of the oil. 

Refrigerate

**Flavoring**

Put lime juice and a a chipotle pepper in food processor (no need to clean it from the mayo step) and blend.

Remove from food processor and mix with mayo, by hand, in a bowl with a whisk. To start add lemon zest, 1/2 tsp paprika and chili powder and taste. Then adjust as desired. You can add some sauce from the Chilpotle pepper can, add some hot sauce, add some salt, maybe cayenne pepper, etc... just taste frequently. **Be careful with chilpotle peppers - they're super spicy - you can always add more but can never remove**

**Note** 

On **olive oil**... if you want to use olive oil when making mayo you kind of need to do it by hand and not in a food proccessor. You'l get a richer mayo (which, for this recipe doesn't really matter) but if you put olive-oil in a food processor you'll break down the molecules into really bitter compounds. If you're hell bent on this but still lazy you can make a really loose mayo in your food processor (like 1/4 veg oil) then whisk in the olive oil. 

**Serve with**

This makes an awesome sauce for tacos or as a mayo base for coleslaw if you're making something like pulled-pork sliders. Add some cilantro and a lot more salt and it's great on fresh corn-on-the-cob.
