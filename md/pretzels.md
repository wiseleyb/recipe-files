## Ingredients

- 2 3/4 – 3 cups bread flour
- 1 envelope instant yeast
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1 cup and 1 tablespoon hot water (approx 125[°])
- 1/3 cup baking soda
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 1/2 cup cornmeal
- 1 egg white
- Coarse sea salt, or flaky salt (like Maldon)

## Directions


Place bread flour, yeast, salt and sugar in food processor and pulse to combine. While the food processor is running gradually add hot water until elastic dough forms, about 5 minutes. Place dough in an oiled bowl and cover with plastic and allow dough to double in volume, about 30 minutes

Punch down dough on a floured work surface and divide into 8 pieces and shape into round buns. Slash tops of each bun with an ‘X’ using a serrated knife, cover with a towel and let rise until doubled again, about 25 minutes.

Preheat oven to 375[°]. Grease a baking sheet and sprinkle with cornmeal. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add sugar and baking soda (the baking soda will make the water bubble heavily, so add it gradually). Boil each roll for 30 seconds, then flip and cook for another 30 seconds. Place on prepared baking sheet brush with egg white and sprinkle with salt. Bake until brown, about 25 minutes.

These really only are good the first day. After that the salt starts to disolve and make them soggy. The only solution I've found that doesn't completely suck is to put them in a paper bag and cover with a dish towel. But, even doing that they're pretty much trash by day 3 and pretty bad day 2.

For sausage buns: divide into 8 balls before forming.
For smallish sub buns: divide into 6 balls for forming.
