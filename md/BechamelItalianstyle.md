## Ingredients

- 6 tablespoons butter 
- 6 tablespoons flour 
- 4 1/2 cups milk 
- 1 teaspoon salt 
- 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg

## Directions

In a saucepan, melt the butter over low heat and stir in the flour, stirring constantly until smooth, about 2 minutes. Slowly whisk the milk into the flour, stirring vigorously to blend together. Set over high heat and quickly bring to a boil for 1 minute, stirring. Allow to cook another 5 minutes, or until floury taste is gone. Remove from heat and add salt and nutmeg to taste.
