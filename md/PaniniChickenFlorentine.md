## Ingredients

- 1 (10-oz. can) refrigerated pizza crust
- 1 (9-oz.) package frozen spinach
- 1/4 C. light mayonnaise
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 T. olive oil
- 1 C. chopped red onion
- 1 T. sugar
- 1 T. vinegar (cider, red wine or balsamic)
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves
- 1/2 t. dried Italian seasoning
- 4 (4-inch) slices provolone cheese

## Directions

Heat oven to 375 F.. Unroll dough; place in ungreased 15-by-10-by-1-inch baking pan. Starting at center, press out dough to edges of pan. Bake at 375 F. for 10 minutes. Cool 15 minutes or until completely cool.  
  
 Meanwhile, cook spinach as directed on package. Drain; squeeze dry with paper towels.  
  
 In small bowl, combine mayonnaise and one of the garlic cloves. Mix and refrigerate. Heat oil in small saucepan over medium-high heat until hot.  
  
 Add onion; cook and stir 2 to 3 minutes or until crisp-tender. Add sugar and vinegar. Reduce heat to low; simmer 3 to 5 minutes or until most of liquid has evaporated, stirring occasionally. To flatten each chicken breast half, place, boned side up, between two pieces of plastic wrap or waxed paper. Working from center, gently pound chicken with flat side of meat mallet or rolling pin until about 1/4-inch thick; remove wrap.  
  
 Sprinkle chicken with Italian seasoning and minced garlic.  
  
 Spray large skillet with nonstick cooking spray. Heat over medium-high heat until hot. Add chicken; cook 8 minutes or until browned, tender and juices run clear. Turn once.  
  
 Cut cooled pizza crust into 4 rectangles.  
  
 Remove rectangles from pan; spread each with 1 tablespoon mayonnaise mixture. Top 2 rectangles with chicken, spinach, onion mixture, cheese and remaining crust rectangles, mayonnaise side down.  
  
 Heat large skillet or cast iron skillet over medium heat until hot.  
  
 Place sandwiches in skillet. Place a smaller skillet on sandwiches to flatten slightly. Cook about 1 to 2 minutes or until crisp and heated, turning once. Cut each sandwich into quarters.
