## Ingredients

- Green Curry Paste: 
- 6 spring onions, washed and trimmed 
- 4 to 6 medium green chilies, seeded and finely chopped 
- 2 cloves garlic 
- 1 tablespoon fresh ginger root, peeled and finely chopped 
- 1 tablespoon coriander seeds, pounded and crushed 
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
- Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste 
- 1/2 handful lime leaves, torn 
- 2 lemon grass stalks, trimmed back and finely chopped 
- 2 good handfuls fresh basil on the stalk 
- 3 good handfuls fresh coriander on the stalk 
- 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 
- 4 limes, zested and juiced 
- 4 chicken breasts without bone and skin, each cut into 5 large pieces 
- 16 ounces coconut milk 
- 1 handful chopped pistachio nuts

## Directions

Put all the green curry paste ingredients in a food processor and whizz to a smooth green paste. Marinate the chicken in a little of the paste for 30 minutes, then add a little oil and the chicken pieces to a hot casserole-type pan or wok. Fry for 4 minutes, then add the remainder of the marinade - it will sizzle and spit. Stir in the coconut milk, bring to the boil and simmer gently for 8 minutes until the chicken is cooked. Season to taste. The flavor should have a kick but be reasonably mellow - very fresh and fragrant.   
  
Sprinkle with the pistachios and some coriander leaves and serve with steamed rice or noodles, and chunky coconut, tomato, cucumber and lime relish.
