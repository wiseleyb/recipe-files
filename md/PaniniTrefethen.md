 Trim rounded top and the bottom off the rosemary bread. Cut the loaf lengthwise into 1/2" thick slices.  
  
 Place a single layer of provolone cheese on one slice of the bread. Add a layer of prosciutto, roasted red bell pepper, roasted eggplant, onion relish, arugula and another layer of provolone cheese. Top with another slice of bread, brush top and bottom of sandwich with olive oil.
