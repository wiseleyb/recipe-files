## Ingredients

- 20 ounces (about 4 cups. 1lb 4oz) of bread flour, preferably Italian-style "OO"
- .4 ounces kosher salt (about 4 teaspoons)
- .3 ounces (about 2 teaspoons) instant yeast, such as SAF Instant Yeast
- 13 ounces water

## Directions

1. Combine flour, salt, and yeast in a large bowl and whisk until homogenous.
   Add water and incorporate into flour using your hands until no dry flour remains
   on the bottom of the bowl. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and allow it to rise at
   room temperature for 8 to 12 hours.

2. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide into four even balls.
   Place each in a covered quart-sized deli container or in a zipper-lock
   freezer bag. Place in refrigerator and allow to rise at least 2 more days,
   and up to 4. Remove from refrigerator, shape into balls, and allow to rest
   at room temperature for at least 2 hours before baking.

## Notes

You can add a few tablespoons of olive oil for a softer crust.

When I make this it makes 7 dough balls. I like to keep 1 of those and add it
back into the dough when making another batch. This adds a sourdough flavor and
more complexity over time.
