## Ingredients

- 2.75kg/6lb chicken bones, wings and carcasses
- 900g/2lb white of leek
- 2 onions
- 4 stalks celery
- 175g/6oz button mushrooms
- 2 cloves garlic
- 2 sprigs parsley
- 2 sprigs fresh thyme
- 1 bay leaf
- 1tsp white peppercorns

## Directions

Chicken stock when made should be crystal clear, jellied and a delicate pale colour. It will keep for up to 4 days in the refrigerator or try freezing it in small quantities then take out only the amount you need for a particular recipe.   
  
 Finely chop the vegetables and wash them well. Remove any excess fat from the bones and rinse them well in a few changes of cold water. Place the bones in a saucepan, cover with cold water and bring to the boil. Tip off the water, rinse the bones and re-cover with cold water. Return to the boil over a high heat. Once it just comes to the boil immediately reduce the heat to a bare simmer. Skim the surface from time to time as necessary; simmer for 30 minutes then add the vegetables. Simmer for a further 1 hour then add the herbs, simmer for a further 30 minutes. Strain the stock through a very fine wire conical sieve or through muslin and cool as quickly as is possible.
