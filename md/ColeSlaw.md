## Ingredients

- Some cabbage (red and white)
- Colemans dry mustard (about a tsp)
- Salt/Pepper
- Cider Vinegar (about a 1 tbs)
- Mayonaisse
- Cayenne
- Shredded carrots
- Red onion

## Directions

The measurements will depend on how much you want to make.  
  
 Slice the cabbage very thin. Shred the carrots. Mix with about 2 tbs kosher salt and place in a strainer for around an hour (over a bowl) until the cabbage wilts.  
  
 Rinse throughly. Press (don't squeeze) out the water (most of it anyways).  
  
 Throw in a bowl and mix in some vinegar (any kind will do but Cider or Rice Wine is nice) and the mustard (you can use Grey Pupon if you don't have Colemans dry mustard). Add onions.   
  
 Mix in mayo until it reaches the consistency you like. Server room temperature.  
  
 This dish doesn't keep so don't make extra.
