## Ingredients

- 1/4 cup olive oil

- 6 cloves minced garlic 
- 2 (28-ounce) cans Roma plum tomatoes, broken into pieces, with juice 
- 1 cup tightly packed, pitted, chopped Kalamata olives

## Directions

In a large pot heat the olive oil over medium high heat. Add the onion and saut until soft and lightly caramelized, about 6 minutes. Add the garlic and cook an additional 2 minutes.
