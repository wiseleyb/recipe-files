## Credits

by Ben Wiseley

## Ingredients

- For the rosti:
- 1 potatoe per person (raw and shredded)
- Thinly sliced onion (about 1/2 an onion)
- Salt 
- Pepper
- 1 egg per 2 potatoes
- 1 shredded carrot
- For hollandaise (makes enough for 6 servings)
- 3 egg yolks
- 2 sticks of clarified butter (you don't have to clarify - but it's easy to hold the sauce if you do)
- 1 tbs lemon juice
- salt
- paprika
- Misc:
- 2 eggs per person
- 2 slices canadian bacon per person
- 1 teaspoon of vinegar

## Directions

For the rosti:  
 Scrub the potatoes and place them in a large saucepan. Add enough water to cover the potatoes by 2 inches, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Simmer for 5 minutes; drain. Let the potatoes cool, then chill them for 1 hour or overnight.   
  
 Peel the chilled potatoes, grate them and toss with the chives or parsley, salt, and pepper.   
  
 Coursely grate the potatoes and mix with egg(s), carrot, onion salt and pepper. If the potatoes aren't sticking together you can add some flour, cornmeal or another eggs.  
  
 Over medium heat cook rosti until brown on both sides in some butter. Transer to the oven to keep them warm. I use an egg round (name? a cookie cutter type device that's round that make's "egg mcmuffin" style eggs) to form the rosti.  
  
 For hollandaise:  
 You want to wisk hollandaise over not quite boiling water. I use a pasta pan and a stainless steel mixing bowl.  
  
 Over very low heat: add a little of the clarified butter a tsp of water, a pinch of salt and the lemon juice and wisk until combine. Add egg yolks and whisk until they begin to increase in volume, thicken and have a sheen to them. If, at any point, the eggs begin to cook (become lumpy) immediately remove the bowl from heat and continue whisking. See Julia Child's book on French cooking for an in depth description of making hollandaise (and all other French sauces). Very slowly add butter while whisking. When done set aside in a warm spot (but not over any heat.  
  
 Put it together:  
 Poach eggs in simmering water with the vinegar and some salt. Put a two rosti on a warm plate, cover with canadian bacon, poached egg and some hollandaise sauce.
