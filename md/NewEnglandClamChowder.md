## Directions

1. Scrub the quahogs thorougly and place in a large pan with 2 cups water and any scraps of onion, celery, thyme and bay leaf you may have around. Cover and place on high heat until the quahogs are steamed comletely open.  
  
 2. Pout off liquid and reserve. Remove the clams from their shells; roughly chop (about 3/8-inch pieces); set aside. Carefully pour the liquid (about 3 cups) through a fine strainer; set aside.  
  
 3. Slowly render bacon or salt pork in a soup pot until slightly crisp. Add the onions, bay leaves, thyme and butter. When the onions are translucent, add the potatoes and the broth from the quahogs. Simmer until potatoes are cooked (about 12 minutes).  
  
 4. Add the chopped clams and cream and simmer 5 minutes more. Season to taste with pepper and add chopped parsley. Ladle into soup plates or cups.  
  
 Note: Salt pork is traditional, but the smoky flavor of bacon is better.
