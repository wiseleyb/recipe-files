## Ingredients

- 1 1/3 cups yellow cornmeal
- 3/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 large eggs
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
- 1 cup milk

## Directions

Preparation

Preheat oven to 425ÂºF. Put an 8-inch cast iron pan in the oven for 10 minutes.

Stir together cornmeal, flour, baking powder, sugar and salt in a bowl. In a
separate bowl, whisk together eggs, melted butter and milk. Add the wet
ingredients to the dry and mix until just combined. Do not overmix.

Remove the pan from the oven and spray with nonstick spray or brush with
butter. Scrape the batter into the hot pan and bake for 15-18 minutes, or until
lightly golden brown and just baked through.

Let cool in pan for 10 minutes. Remove from pan and let sit out overnight if
using for dressing.
