## Ingredients

- 2 eggs, whites and yolks separated
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 4 tablespoons butter, melted, plus extra for the pan
- 2 cups buttermilk

*1/2 recipe (makes 15 or so)*

- 1 eggs, whites and yolks separated
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 tablespoon sugar
- 1 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons butter, melted, plus extra for the pan
- 1 cups buttermilk

## Directions

In a medium bowl, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer until stiff peaks
form.

In a separate, large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, salt, baking soda,
and sugar.  Stir well, then add the egg yolks, melted butter and buttermilk and
mix just until combined.

Gently fold the beaten egg whites into the batter.  Batter will be fairly
thick.

Heat your aebleskiver pan over medium heat until hot.  Brush each cup with a
little melted butter using a pastry brush, then fill each cup with about 2
tablespoons of batter until almost full.

As soon as the aebleskivers begin to bubble around the edges, use a wooden
skewer, chopstick, knitting needle, or fork to flip them over half way, letting
the batter slide around to fill in the bottom of the cup.

Continue cooking, turning the aebleskiver again to let the batter fill in the
remainder of the sphere and continuing to turn until golden brown all the way
around and cooked through.

Transfer to a serving plate and dust with powdered sugar, then serve with jam
(traditional), honey, cinnamon honey (my favorite!), or even just syrup.
