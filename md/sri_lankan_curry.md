## Credits

Mini

Serves about 2 people
Time: 45+ minutes

## Ingredients

- 1/2 tsp Mustard Seeds
- 1/4 tsp Fenugreek seeds
- 1 tbsp Curry Powder ([Sri Lankan Curry Recipe](https://www.theflavorbender.com/sri-lankan-roasted-curry-powder/))
- pinch of red-pepper flakes

- 1-2 cloves Garlic (minced)
- 1/2 inch ginger (minced - optional)
- 1 small/medium onion (diced)
- 1/2 can whole san marzano tomatoes
- 1/4-1/2 can coconut milk
- 1 Potato cut into 1/2-1" cubes (or, be fancy and use a melon baller)
- 2-3 bone-in chicken thighs, with skin

Nan/Rice (optional) for serving

## Directions

In a small saute pan toast (dry pan - no oil) whole spices (mustard/fenugreek seed) (and any other whole spices) until fragrent. Crush/blend in coffee mill or mortar-pestle.

Saute skin-on-chicken thighs to render fat for 5-10 minutes on both sides. KEEP FAT. Remove chicken to a bowl for later.

In chicken fat saute onion for 5 minutes or so, add garlic, saute another minute, add spices and saute a bit longer.

Deglaze pan with white wine - reduce until nearly dry.

Add about 1/2 can of tomatoes (with suace) and crush up whole tomatoes with spoon. Add about 1/2 can of cocunut milk. Bring to simmer.

Add chicken back into pan. And simmer for 20+ minutes.

In a different pot - add cubed potatoes and salt, par boil potatoes until almost fork tender. Drain and add potatoes to curry.

Optionally debone chicken thighs, discard skin. And seasson to taste with salt/pepper/hot-sauce.

If you have a lemon you can brighten it up a bit with some lemon juice (acid).

And you're done. Maybe serve over basmati/safron rice or with Nan. 

## Notes

Curry powder takes a while to "cook out" (to lose the powdery taste). You can simmer this for a LONG time. Chicken thighs are really hard to over-cook. And the sauce gets better with time. So - 20 minutes minimum... but don't stress if it's longer.

You can also cook the potatoes in the same pan (and skip par boiling). I just par boil to avoid over cooking potatoes while messing with the base sauce.
