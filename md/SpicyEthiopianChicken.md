Fragrant spice blends distinguish the peppery dishes of the African nation of Ethiopia. Serve the chicken with pita bread, braised collard greens, and plain yogurt, which is used as a condiment. Purchased baklava makes an excellent dessert.

Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in same skillet. Add onion; saute 3 minutes. Add ginger; saute 1 minutes. Return chicken to skillet. Add 1 cup water; bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; cover and simmer until chicken is cooked through, about 7 minutes. Transfer chicken to 2 plates; cover with foil. INcrease heat; boil sauce until slightly thickened, about 7 minutes. Season sauce with salt and pepper and spoon over chicken.

**Notes:**
