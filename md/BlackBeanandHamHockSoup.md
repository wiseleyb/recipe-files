## Directions

1. Place the beans in a large pot with the chicken stock and ham hock. Bring to a simmer and cook until the beans are soft, about 2 hours (1 hour if the beans have been presoaked).  
  
2. Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a saute pan over medium-low heat and slowly cook the oinions, carrorts, and celery, stirring occasionally, until the onions are golden and carmaelized, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in garlic for the last few minutes of cooking. Add the onion mixture, tomatoes, tomato paste, and ground spices to the simmering beans. Continue to simmer until everything is very soft, about another hour. PUIll out the ham hock and remove the fat and skin. Pull all the lean meat off the bone, finely chop the meat, and set aside. In a food processor or blender, coarsely puree the beans in batches just enough to leave a little texture. Return the soup to the pot and add the chopped meat. Season with paprika, cayenne, lime juice, salt, and black pepper. Just before serving, stir in the chopped cilantro.  
  
Serve with [Roasted Tomatillo Salsa](/recipe/index.php?title=Roasted_Tomatillo_Salsa "Roasted Tomatillo Salsa") and sour cream.
