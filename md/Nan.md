## Ingredients

- 1 c Flour
- 1 pk Yeast, dry
- 2 ts Salt
- 1 c Water, hot
- 1 c Buttermilk -- or yogurt
- 1 Egg -- (room temp)
- 2 tb Oil
- 1 tb Honey -- or sugar
- 2 1/2 c Flour
- Butter/Ghee

## Directions

Combine 1 cup flour, yeast, and salt in a mixing bowl. Stir in water, buttermilk, egg, oil and honey. Beat until smooth with an electric mixer. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft, sticky dough. Turn onto a floured surface, continue to work in flour until dough is stiff enough to knead. Knead until smooth and elastic, but still soft (3 to 5 minutes). Place in an oiled bowl; turning once to coat top of dough. Cover; let rise until double in bulk (about 45 minutes). Punch dough down. Shape into 16 equal balls. Let rest 5 minutes. Roll out each ball to a 1/4-inch thick round. If desired, brush with melted butter and sprinkle with garnishes. Set on baking sheets. Bake at 450 degrees F. for 5 to 8 minutes. NOTE: There is no second rising in this recipe so that you get flat loaves.
