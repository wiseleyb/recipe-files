## Directions

Spicy Thai dish.

1. Heat 4 quarts water (with salt) to boiling. If youre using veggies that need to be blanched before stir frying (see note) blanch them now and use a slotted spoon to remove them.  
  
 2. Once water is boiling remove from heat. Soak noodles for 4 minutes then rinse in cold water and set aside.  
  
 3. Add enough oil to coat the bottom of a large wok. Stir fry (saute) white parts of green onions. Add diced chilis and garlic (don't allow garlic to brown or your dish will suck). Add 1/3 of the basil.  
  
 4. After maybe 30 seconds add the veggies in the order they need to be cooked in (see note) and stir fry until barely done.  
  
 5. Add fish sauce, soy sauce, the rest of the green onions, the rest of the basil and the rice noodles and stir fry for about 3 mintues more (until well combined).   
  
 6. Adjust flavor and serve.

notes:  
  
 Fish Sauce: this stuff smells horrible but really improves the dish. Don't add to much and try to keep some blind faith that it will work in the end despite the smell. The dish is horrible if you don't add the fish sauce.  
  
 Veggies: For those of you who never stir fry (or cook). Veggies have different cooking times. If you try to stir fry brocolli (for example) you'll end up with raw brocolli with a mushy out side. The trick is to blanch the larger vegetables (brocolli, beans, etc.). Do this by boiling a lot of salted water and blanching the veggies for 2 minutes or so.  
  
 Chilis: These chillis are red and usually sold dried. They're spicy as all hell - don't be a macho moron and add 3 times the amount or you'll need to go to the hospital.
