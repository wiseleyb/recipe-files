## Ingredients

- 1 cup canola oil 
- 4 (8-ounce) cubed steaks (top or bottom round ends)
- Salt and black pepper, to taste
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon dried thyme
- 1 tablespoon dried basil 
- Chicken fat or vegetable oil for frying
- 3 Vidalia onions, sliced
- 1/2 pound paris mushrooms, prepped and sliced
- 1 cup dry red wine
- 2 tablespoon naturally brewed soy sauce
- 2 cups chicken stock
- 1/4 cup chives, chopped for garnish
- 8 large Yukon potatoes, washed, baked in the oven until a fork comes cleanly off, 350 degrees, about 45 minutes

## Directions

In a large heavy skillet, heat the canola oil on high heat. Season the steaks with salt and pepper. On a plate, mix the flour, thyme, and basil. Dredge the steaks in the flour and fry in canola oil, about 4 to 5 minutes a side, until brown. Set steaks aside to rest and remove all but 3 tablespoons canola oil. Add enough seasoned flour until it becomes thick, like soft clay (roux), and stir with a whisk for 3 to 4 minutes until smooth and cooked through. Remove roux. In the same skillet, add the onions and mushrooms, season and brown well, 8 to 10 minutes. Deglaze with red wine and reduce completely. Add the soy and chicken stock and bring to a boil. Whisk in 1 tablespoon of roux until thick. If not thickened enough, whisk in more roux. Check for flavor.   
  
 PLATING On a dinner plate, place 2 potatoes down, split open and smother with gravy. Lean 1 steak next to the potatoes and garnish with chives.
