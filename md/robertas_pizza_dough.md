## Ingredients

- 153g 00 Flour
- 153g All purpose/bread flour
- 8g sea salt
- 2g active dry yeast
- 4g olive oil
- 200g luke warm water

## Directions

Step 1
In a large mixing bowl, combine flours and salt.

Step 2
In a small mixing bowl, stir together 200 grams (a little less than 1 cup)
lukewarm tap water, the yeast and the olive oil, then pour it into flour
mixture. Knead with your hands until well combined, approximately 3 minutes,
then let the mixture rest for 15 minutes.

Step 3
Knead rested dough for 3 minutes. Cut into 2 equal pieces and shape each into a
ball. Place on a heavily floured surface, cover with dampened cloth, and let
rest and rise for 3 to 4 hours at room temperature or for 8 to 24 hours in the
refrigerator. (If you refrigerate the dough, remove it 30 to 45 minutes before
you begin to shape it for pizza.)

Step 4 
To make pizza, place each dough ball on a heavily floured surface and
use your fingers to stretch it, then your hands to shape it into rounds or
squares. Top and bake.
