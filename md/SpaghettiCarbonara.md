## Ingredients

- 1/2 pound bacon, chopped
- 1 tablespoon chopped garlic
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 1 pound fresh spaghetti, cooked al dente
- 4 large eggs, beaten
- Salt
- 1 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano 
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley leaves

## Directions

In a large sauti pan, over medium heat, cook the bacon until crispy, about 6 minutes. Remove the bacon and drain on paper towels. Pour off all of the oil except for 3 tablespoons. Add the garlic. Season with black pepper. Sauti for 30 seconds. Add the crispy bacon and the pasta. Sauti for 1 minute. Season the eggs with salt. Remove the pan from the heat and add the eggs, whisking quickly until the eggs thicken, but do not scramble. Add the cheese and re-season with salt and pepper. Mound into serving bowls and garnish with parsley.
